An adaptation of the Odoo software, which is benefited from more than 15 years of development and use in thousands of companies, it is a robust and efficient management software. It was created to enable this software to be adapted to Singapore, Malaysia and ASEAN standards and to accelerate its development in Asia.

<br />
The Odoo framewoork on which PerfectWork Business Solution Platform is installed also allows the installation of other applications. You can thus develop your own customizations, host them on your server and evolve them in parallel with Odoo, without modifying its source code. This allows you to control maintenance costs, while leaving great flexibility to optimize your software platform.

<br/>
With its default multi-tenant architecture, Odoo software allows you to host multiple sites with independent databases, but which can use the same applications.
