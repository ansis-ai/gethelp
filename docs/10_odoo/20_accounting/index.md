Accounting can be defined as a procedure of reporting, documenting, illustrating, and summarizing financial data. Accounting is a crucial part of an organization or company. It is the central focus unit for handling all areas of business transactions.

<br/>
Throughout the centuries, accounting has been revived as an enclosed structure for keeping financial records and assisting an accountant's duties.

Accounting has to do more than mere bookkeeping and generating financial reports.
