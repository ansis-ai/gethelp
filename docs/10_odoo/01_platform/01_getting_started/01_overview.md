PerfectWORK is a very feature-filled business application framework, with literally hundreds of applications and modules available. When you first access your PerfectWORK instance, the only functionality you will have is a limited messaging options between users. From there, PerfectWORK allows you to purchase and install the applications you need, as you need them. This flexibility makes PerfectWORK much more accessible than many business software solutions.

<br />

Not long ago, nearly all companies kept their primary information systems in-house. This approach not only requires a lot of capital expense in purchasing servers and software licenses, but also creates a lot of responsibilities and risks in backing up data and ensuring business continuity. Today, more and more companies are choosing to host their business applications in online networks commonly called the cloud. PerfectWORK allows you the flexibility of both optionsâ€”either hosting on your own hardware, or utilizing PerfectWORK's online software services.

<br />

The best thing about accessing PerfectWORK Online is that you can jump in and start using the software right away. You don't have to decide what operating system (OS) to use, and you don't have to install any software at all. Just enter the URL into your web browser and you are ready to get started.

<br />

Another added benefit of taking this approach is that you will verify that your web browser is up to date and compatible with the latest version of PerfectWORK. You can expect to put a great deal of time into determining which PerfectWORK applications / modules are right for your company.
Taking a few hours to use the PerfectWORK Online version is time well spent, and you can put off installing PerfectWORK until you are more certain it is the right software for your business.

### Browser Requirement

PerfectWORK is designed to run on a variety of modern web browsers. Supported browsers include the following:
- Google Chrome (recommended) 
- Firefox
- Microsoft Edge
- Safari

!!! tip
    Macintosh users will need to make sure they are running macOS X or above. Users running older Macintosh systems are currently having difficulties running PerfectWORK version 3. Also, in our experience, Google Chrome tends to offer the best experience in working with PerfectWORK. 

### Mobile phone and tablet support

PerfectWORK has included native support for mobile phones and tablets. Menus are designed to flow and format properly. The new website application even includes a preview within the portal administration to emulate how the site would appear on a mobile phone. While you still suffer many of the limitations that come with a small screen size, the applications are functional and this makes it even easier for developers to create mobile Odoo applications.
