## Fiscal localization packages[¶](https://www.odoo.com/documentation/16.0/applications/finance/fiscal_localizations.html#fiscal-localization-packages "Permalink to this headline")

**Fiscal Localization Packages** are country-specific modules that install pre-configured taxes, fiscal positions, chart of accounts, and legal statements on your database. Some additional features, such as the configuration of specific certificates, are also added to your Accounting app, following your fiscal administration requirements.

Note

Odoo continuously adds new localizations and improves the existing packages.
