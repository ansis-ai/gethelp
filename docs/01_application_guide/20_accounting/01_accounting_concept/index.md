## Double Entry Bookkeeping System

Double-entry bookkeeping in accounting is a system of recording transactions. In this system, the entry is recorded as at least two accounts: debit and credit. In this system, the debit and credit amounts recorded must be balanced. This means the amount of the recorded debits must equal the amount recorded as credits. So the system will help you to record the transaction on two sides. In this system, when a transaction occurs and gets impacted in an account, a matched impact will occur in the other account. The corresponding debit value will be recorded for the credit value. In addition, the credited and debited accounts will be listed in the company chart of accounts.
<br />
<br />
When considering an example, suppose a sale is confirmed for $ 200. There will be an impact on both the Income Account and the Receivable Account. Since it is a sale for the organization, the income increases. So the income increases and the income account credits $200. As Assets increase and as result, the receivable account debits $200. The nature of the account will decide whether an account should be credited or debited.

Finance is the fundamental element for future success. So as a business leader, you must be bothered about the accounting hierarchy of your business or organization. The accounting hierarchy is very important without considering the size and type of business. In the general accounting system, all of the transaction details are properly entered into the equivalent ledgers. The way transaction details are registered on both sides ( the credit and debit side of accounts) is decided by its nature. For general accounting, there follows a hierarchy.
