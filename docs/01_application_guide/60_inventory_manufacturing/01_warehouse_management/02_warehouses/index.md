Warehouse management is one of the impartial activities in the inventory operations of a company. For the smooth functioning of the stock operations and transfers, the warehouses of a company should be managed and monitored properly. Odoo, being an excellent inventory management assistant can offer you dedicated platforms for the effective management of warehouses of the company. The tools offered by Odoo can help you to manage multiple warehouses simultaneously. The number of warehouses owned by a company will differ according to the type of business they run. No matter the size and number of warehouses a company owns, Odoo will always ensure to streamline the workflow.

In the **Configuration** menu of the Odoo Inventory module, you will get advanced options such Warehouse, Locations, Routes, Rules, Operation Types, Storage Categories, Storage Category Capacity, and Putaway Rules in the Warehouse Management tab.

These options will assist you in performing different warehouse management operations. First, let’s take a look at the configuration of warehouses in the Odoo 16 Inventory module. For this, you can select the **Warehouses** option from the **Configuration** menu.

In this window, you can specify the **Warehouse, Short Name** of the warehouse, **Company, Address,** and **Intrastat Region** to which the warehouse belongs in the corresponding fields. Under the **Warehouse Configuration** tab, you are requested to mention the Shipments and Resupply details.

In the **Incoming Shipment,** you can decide how to manage the incoming shipment of the products. By selecting the **Receive goods directly** option, you can receive products directly to the warehouse. In the case of the **Receive goods in input and then stock** method, the incoming shipment includes two-step. In this two-step process, the products will be received first and then moved to the stock. After receiving the goods, you can apply quality checks on them before stocking using the Receive goods in **input, then quality, and then stock** method of incoming shipment. Similar options will be available for the Outgoing Shipment also and you can select the suitable one for the shipment operations of this warehouse.

Under the **Resupply** tab, you will get advanced features to activate.

Activating the **Dropship Subcontractors** feature will help you to dropship subcontractors with components. **The Resupply Subcontractors** can be used to resupply subcontractors with the components. This will help the manufacturer to supply materials to the subcontractors when required. If the company has many warehouses, you can resupply components from one to another using these features. When raw materials are in demand, you can easily resupply them in warehouses. When products are out of stock, you can manufacture them in the warehouse for resupply by activating the **Manufacture Resupply** option. You will get three methods to define manufacturing procedures. By selecting the **Manufacture** option, you can directly move the components to the production location and start the manufacturing procedures. In the **Pick components and then manufacture** method, you need to follow two steps. First, you have to unload the components from the stock to the input location and then move to the production location for manufacturing. After picking the components and manufacturing the products, you can store them in the warehouse using the **Pick components, manufacture, and then store products** option. By activating the **Buy to Resupply option,** Odoo allows you to buy raw materials to resupply and store them in this warehouse. Clicking on the **Save** button will record the details of the newly configured warehouse.

The smart button **Routes** given on the top right corner of the window will give access to the routes management window of the operations of this warehouse.
