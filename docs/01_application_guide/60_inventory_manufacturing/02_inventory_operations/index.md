Odoo Inventory module is the best option for the effective management of all types of inventory operations. Providing proper support for inventory management in a company is essential to run the business flawlessly. When we talk about Odoo as the perfect solution for inventory management, you will be inquisitive about the features it offers. In this section, we will detail the inventory operations managed by Odoo with the dedicated Inventory module. The **Overview** window of the Inventory module itself will give a clear insight into all possible operations managed by the module.

[![Odoo 16 inventory](https://www.images.cybrosys.com/images/odoo-book-16/odoo-book-16-inventory-64.png)](https://www.images.cybrosys.com/images/odoo-book-16/odoo-book-16-inventory-64.png)

From the Kanban view of the Inventory Overview window, you will be able to manage the Receipt, Internal Transfers, Delivery Orders, Returns, Manufacturing, Resupply Subcontractor, POS Orders, Dropship, Dropship Subcontractor, and many more based on the operations configured in the module. You will get exclusive options in the menu bar of the Inventory module to manage all these operations separately. But, this platform will help you to get an overview of all operations at a glance. The three vertical dots given on the top right corner of each operation tab will give you additional tools to manage each of these operations. If the database is working in a multi-company environment, then the overview will include the inventory operations of all companies configured in your system.

### Creating new operation types

In the Odoo 16 Inventory module, you can effortlessly create new operation types with the help of the dedicated tools introduced in the module. The **Operation Types** menu can be accessed from the **Configuration** menu as shown below.

Clicking on this option opens a new window with the details of the already configured operation types. You can make changes to the available operation types by selecting them from the given list. Here, we are going to create a new Operation Type. So, click on the **Create** button.

[![Odoo 16 inventory](https://www.images.cybrosys.com/images/odoo-book-16/odoo-book-16-inventory-66.png)](https://www.images.cybrosys.com/images/odoo-book-16/odoo-book-16-inventory-66.png)

Here, you will get a new window to create a new operation type. You can mention the **Operation Type** in the corresponding field. Mention the Reference Sequence, Code, Barcode, Reservation Method, and Company in the respective fields. The Reservation Method will decide how the products in transfers of this operation type should be preserved. It can be either at confirmation, manually, or before the scheduled date. When validating a transfer, you can ask your users to choose if they want to create a backorder for the remaining products by selecting the option **Ask** in the **Create Backorder** field. By selecting the Always option, Odoo will automatically create a backorder for the remaining products. Selecting the **Never** option will cancel the remaining products. If you want to show a detailed stock operation in the picking lines then you can check the **Show Detailed Operation** box.

The **Default Source Location** and **Default Destination Location** of the transfers of this operation type can be specified in the corresponding fields under the **Locations** tab.

The **Type of Operation** can be Receipt, Delivery, Manufacturing, or Internal Transfer. Based on the Type of Operation you select, there will be small changes in the remaining fields. Each Type of Operation has different configuration options. For example, if you select Receipt as the Type of Operation the additional fields that appear on the screen are highlighted below.

 [![Odoo 16 inventory](https://www.images.cybrosys.com/images/odoo-book-16/odoo-book-16-inventory-67.png)](https://www.images.cybrosys.com/images/odoo-book-16/odoo-book-16-inventory-67.png)[![Odoo 16 inventory](https://www.images.cybrosys.com/images/odoo-book-16/odoo-book-16-inventory-68.png)](https://www.images.cybrosys.com/images/odoo-book-16/odoo-book-16-inventory-68.png)

Here, in the case of Receipt, you can activate the **Show Reception Report at Validation** feature if you want to get an automated reception report at the time of validation. In the **Operation Type for Returns** field, you can specify the operation type suitable for the return operations of the products. Odoo will automatically pre-fill the detailed operations with the corresponding products, location, and lot/serial numbers.

By activating the Create New Lots/Serial Numbers option from the Traceability tab, Odoo will allow you to create new lots/serial numbers for the products in the transfers of this operation type. You can also use the existing lots/serial numbers for product transfers by activating the Use Existing Lots/Serial Numbers option. By checking the Move Entire Packages box from the Packages tab, you will be able to select entire packages to move.

The Product traceability feature offered by Odoo will assist in tracing and tracking each and every component of a product. Tracking a product at each stage of stock movement is necessary to bring all operations under control. In order to ensure effective monitoring of the stock movement, lots and serial numbers play an important role. From manufacturing processes to delivery operations, product traceability will keep a proper track that improves the efficiency of stock management. Proper monitoring is required to reduce the risk factors during the stock movements of any company. The Odoo ERP system will record exact details of the stock movement of each component of a product in inventory in the form of a traceability report. The user can observe the whole production to distribution procedures in the inventory using the lots and serial numbers.

Lots and serial numbers are not exactly the same. Commonly we use a lot as a unique identification number to identify a group of products of the same type. If the products are small or can not count as individual products, you can put them together in a single pack and allot a lot number. They are picked as batches in the inventory. For individual products, you can assign serial numbers. The serial number is considered to identify individual products in the inventory.

We allocate lots and serial numbers for products at the time of their inventory management. You can assign lots and serial numbers to the products while configuring them in the Inventory module so that you can easily keep the traceability report of the respective products thereafter. The inventory management tools offered by Odoo 16 support this traceability feature to ensure effective tracking operations. In order to get the complete features of the traceability in the Inventory module, you are requested to activate the **Lots & Serial Numbers** option from the **Settings** menu.

Now, letâ€™s check how to set expiration dates on lots and serial numbers.

### Expiration Date

Defining expiration dates for the storable or consumable products in your inventory is a crucial task. You should definitely mention the expiration date on each product so that the customer will get knowledge about the safety period to consume the product. Odoo manages the expiration dates of the products using the lots and serial numbers aspects. You can activate this feature from the **Settings** menu of the Inventory module.

When this option is activated, you will be able to specify the dates to manage product expiration on the product and on the corresponding lots/serial numbers. As soon as you activate this option, you will get some additional fields to define some important dates which are detailed below.
