We eneed to use both Odoo OCA library for PerfectWORK database migration:

-   [https://github.com/OCA/OpenUpgrade](https://github.com/OCA/OpenUpgrade)
    
-   [https://github.com/OCA/openupgradelib](https://github.com/OCA/openupgradelib)
    

The branches in the first project contain the framework, as well as the database analysis and the migration scripts.
<br /><br />

The second project contains a library with helper functions. It can be used in the migration of any PerfectWORK module.
