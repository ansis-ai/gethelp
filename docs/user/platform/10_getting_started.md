## Application and Modules


**Installing or uninstalling apps and managing users is up to you.**
As the administrator of your database, you are responsible for its usage, as you know best how your organization works.
- **PerfectWORK apps have dependencies.**Installing some apps and features with dependencies may also install additional apps and modules that are technically required, even if you won’t actively use them.
- **Test app installation/removal on a duplicate of your database.**This way, you can know what app dependencies may be required or what data may be erased.


### Install apps and modules

Go to <span class="menuselection">Apps</span>, and click on the *Install* button of the app you want to install.

<p class="callout info">If the module you are looking for is not listed, you can **update the app list**.</p>

To do so, activate the [<span class="std std-ref">developer mode</span>](https://www.odoo.com/documentation/14.0/applications/general/developer_mode.html#developer-mode), then go to <span class="menuselection">Apps ‣ Update Apps List</span> and click on *Update*.

### Upgrade apps and modules

On some occasions, new improvements or app features are added to [<span class="doc">supported versions of PerfectWORK</span>](https://www.odoo.com/documentation/14.0/administration/maintain/supported_versions.html). To be able to use them, you must **upgrade** your app.

Go to <span class="menuselection">Apps</span>, click on the *dropdown menu* of the app you want to upgrade, then on *Upgrade*.

Go to <span class="menuselection">Apps</span>, click on the *dropdown menu* of the app you want to uninstall, then on *Uninstall*.

![../../_images/uninstall.png](https://www.odoo.com/documentation/14.0/_images/uninstall.png)Some apps have dependencies, meaning that one app requires another. Therefore, uninstalling one app may uninstall multiple apps and modules. PerfectWORK warns you which dependant apps and modules are affected by it.

![../../_images/uninstall_deps.png](https://www.odoo.com/documentation/14.0/_images/uninstall_deps.png)To complete the uninstallation, click on *Confirm*.

<p class="callout danger">Uninstalling an app also uninstalls all its dependencies and permanently erases their data.</p>
