Odoo Business Platform is a very feature-filled business application framework, with literally hundreds of applications and modules available. When you first access your Odoo Business Platform instance, the only functionality you will have is a limited messaging options between users. From there, Odoo Business Platform allows you to purchase and install the applications you need, as you need them. This flexibility makes Odoo Business Platform much more accessible than many business software solutions.

<br />

The best thing about accessing Odoo Business Platform Online is that you can jump in and start using the software right away. You don't have to decide what operating system (OS) to use, and you don't have to install any software at all. Just enter the URL into your web browser and you are ready to get started.

<br />

Another added benefit of taking this approach is that you will verify that your web browser is up to date and compatible with the latest version of Odoo Business Platform. You can expect to put a great deal of time into determining which Odoo Business Platform applications / modules are right for your company.
Taking a few hours to use the Odoo Business Platform Online version is time well spent, and you can put off installing Odoo Business Platform until you are more certain it is the right software for your business.

### Browser Requirement

Odoo Business Platform is designed to run on a variety of modern web browsers. Supported browsers include the following:
- Google Chrome (recommended) 
- Firefox
- Microsoft Edge
- Safari

!!! tip
    Macintosh users will need to make sure they are running macOS X or above. Users running older Macintosh systems are currently having difficulties running Odoo Business Platform version 3. Also, in our experience, Google Chrome tends to offer the best experience in working with Odoo Business Platform. 

### Mobile phone and tablet support

Odoo Business Platform has included native support for mobile phones and tablets. Menus are designed to flow and format properly. The new website application even includes a preview within the portal administration to emulate how the site would appear on a mobile phone. While you still suffer many of the limitations that come with a small screen size, the applications are functional and this makes it even easier for developers to create mobile Odoo applications.
