## Multi Currencies

The ANSIS Accounting module includes a comprehensive Currency management feature that allows users to easily manage multiple currencies in their accounts. This feature comprises a currency rate mechanism and an automated currency conversion process.
<br/><br/>

The Currency rate mechanism allows users to define the exchange rate for different types of currencies and set the desired rate for each type. This mechanism also allows users to set different rates for different types of transactions.
<br/><br/>

The automated currency conversion process allows users to automatically convert any transaction amount from one currency to another. This is done by using the currency rate mechanism and the rate set for each type of transaction. It also provides you the provision to set the desired currency symbol to be used when displaying amounts in different currencies. This ensures that all amounts are displayed in the correct currency, and the exchange rates are applied correctly. In addition, users can easily track and report on transactions in different currencies. It is very effective for getting a clear picture of their accounts and transactions in multiple currencies.
<br/><br/>

When we are dealing with multinational businesses, there will be numerous customers and vendors from all over the world. So it is very relevant to have an excellent and powerful currency management system that we possess in the ANSIS platform. The main reason for this is that the different payments, such as vendor bills, invoices, etc need to be completed within their currency and the organization will follow a definite set of currency wherefore the complete operations of the organization are taking place.

### Configuration

When you go for the Configuration menu of the ANSIS Accounting module, you will find the Currencies menu, as shown in the screenshot below.

So the ANSIS Accounting module offers an exclusive tool for managing currency exchange rates. It allows you to easily update the exchange rate of a currency in the system, allowing them to work with multiple currencies. The module also supports multi-currency transactions, which will help users to track their transactions in different currencies. 
<br/><br/>

Additionally, it provides reports that can be used to analyze currency exchange rates and track currency performance. The module also provides a range of options for users to customize their currency exchange rate settings. This enables them to better manage their finances and gain better control over their finances.
<br/><br/>

The Currency Exchange Rates can be betterly handled with the assistance of the Post Exchange difference entries feature available under the Default Accounts section of the ANSIS Accounting Settings window. The screenshot of the tool is showcased below.

<br/><br/>

With this option, the platform offers a chance to define the Journal along with the Gain Account and the Loss Account. Accordingly, if the transaction reaches a loss due to the exchange rate differences, it will be determined in the Loss Account, which is being defined. On the contrary, if the transaction gains an amount in accordance with the changes in the exchange rates, then the amount will be credited to the Gain Account that you have described here. 
<br/><br/>

With the help of these advances and the robust Multi currency management feature of the platform, you can have polished international business operations.
