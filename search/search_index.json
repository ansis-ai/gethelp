You can add as many users as you need and, in order to restrict the type of information each user can access, rules can be applied. Users and access rights can be added and changed at any point. Add individual users \u00b6 Go to Settings \u2023 Manage Users and click on Create . Fill in the form with the needed information. Under the tab Access Rights choose the group within each application the user can have access to. The list of applications shown is based on the applications installed on the database. When you are done editing the page and have Saved it, an invitation email is automatically sent to the user. The user must click on it to accept the invitation and create a login. Remember that subscription prices follow the number of users. With the developer mode activated, User Types can be selected. The Portal and Public options do not allow you to choose access rights. Members have specific ones (such as record rules and restricted menus) and usually do not belong to the usual PerfectWORK groups. Deactivate users \u00b6 Go to Settings \u2023 Users & Companies \u2023 Users , open the user you want to deactivate, click on Action , and then on Archive . **Never** deactivate the main user (*admin*). Passwords Management \u00b6 Reset passwords \u00b6 Enable password resets from login page \u00b6 It is possible to enable password resets directly from the login page. To do so, go to Settings \u2023 Permissions , activate Password Reset and Save . Send reset instructions to users \u00b6 Go to Settings \u2023 Users & Companies \u2023 Users , select the user out of the list and click on Send Password Reset Instructions on its user form. An email is automatically sent to them. The *Send Password Reset Instructions* button only appears if the Odoo invitation email has already been confirmed by the user. This email contains all the instructions needed to reset the password, along with a link redirecting the user to an Odoo login page. Change users\u2019 passwords \u00b6 Go to Settings \u2023 Users & Companies \u2023 Users and select a user to access its form. Click on the Action button and select Change Password . Enter a new password and confirm by clicking on Change Password . This operation only modifies the password of the users locally and does not affect their odoo.com account. If you want to change the odoo.com password, you can [ send the password reset instructions ](https://www.odoo.com/documentation/14.0/applications/general/users/manage_users.html#users-reset-password-email). Click on Change Password one more time. You are then redirected to an Odoo login page where you can reaccess your database using your new password. Access Right \u00b6 Activate the developer mode , then go to Settings \u2023 Users & Companies \u2023 Groups . Groups \u00b6 When choosing the groups the user can have access under [ Access Rights ](https://www.odoo.com/documentation/14.0/applications/general/users/manage_users.html#users-add-individual), details of the rules and inheritances of that group are not shown, so this is when the menu *Groups* comes along. *Groups* are created to define rules to models within an application. Under *Users*, have a list of the current ones. The ones with administrative rights are shown in black. Inherited means that users added to this application group are automatically added to the following ones. In the example below, users who have access to the group Administrator of Sales also have access to Website/Restricted Editor and Sales/User: All Documents . Remember to always test the settings being changed in order to ensure that they are being applied to the needed and right users. The Menus tab is where you define which menus (models) the user can have access to. Access Rights rules are the first level of rights. The field is composed of the object name, which is the technical name given to a model. For each model, enable the following options as appropriate: Read : the values of that object can be only seen by the user. Write : the values of that object can be edited by the user. Create : values for that object can be created by the user. Delete : the values of that object can be deleted by the user. As a second layer of editing and visibility rules, Record Rules can be formed. They overwrite, or refine, the Access Rights . A record rule is written using a Domain . Domains are conditions used to filter or searching data. Therefore, a domain expression is a list of conditions. For each rule, choose among the following options: Read , Write , Create and Delete values. Making changes in access rights can have a big impact on the database. For this reason, we recommend you to contact your PerfectWORK Business Analyst or our Partners, unless you have knowledge about Domains in PerfectWORK. Managing Companies \u00b6 Companies \u00b6 A centralized management environment allows you to select multiple companies simultaneously and set their specific warehouses, customers, equipment, and contacts. It provides you the ability to generate reports of aggregated figures without switching interfaces, which facilitates daily tasks and the overall management process. Manage companies and records \u00b6 Go to Settings \u2023 Manage Companies and fill in the form with your company\u2019s information. If a Parent Company is selected, records are shared between the two companies (as long as both environments are active). Tip Activate the developer mode to choose a Favicon for each of your companies, and easily identify them by the browser tabs. Set your favicons\u2019 files size to 16x16 or 32x32 pixels. JPG, PNG, GIF, and ICO are extensions accepted. Switch between or select multiple companies by enabling their selection boxes to activate them. The grayed company is the one which environment is in use. To switch environments, click on the company\u2019s name. In the example below, the user has access to three companies, two are activated, and the environment in use is of JS Store US . Data such as Products, Contacts, and Equipment can be shared or set to be shown for a specific company only. To do so, on their forms, choose between: A blank field : the record is shared within all companies. Adding a company : the record is visible to users logged in to that specific company. ## Employees\u2019 access Once companies are created, manage your employees\u2019 Access Rights for Multi Companies . If a user has multiple companies activated on his database, and he is editing a record, the editing happens on the record\u2019s related company. Example: if editing a sale order issued under JS Store US while working on the JS Store Belgium environment, the changes are applied under JS Store US (the company from which the sale order was issued). When creating a record, the company taken into account is: - The current company (the one active) or, - No company is set (on products and contacts\u2019 forms for example) or, - The company set is the one linked to the document (the same as if a record is being edited). Documents\u2019 format \u00b6 To set documents\u2019 formats according to each company, activate and select the respective one and, under Settings , click on Configure Document Layout .
