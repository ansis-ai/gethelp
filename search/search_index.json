Browser Requirement \u00b6 PerfectWORK is designed to run on a variety of modern web browsers. Supported browsers include the following: - Google Chrome (recommended) - Firefox - Microsoft Edge - Safari Tip Macintosh users will need to make sure they are running macOS X or above. Users running older Macintosh systems are currently having difficulties running PerfectWORK version 3. Also, in our experience, Google Chrome tends to offer the best experience in working with PerfectWORK. Mobile phone and tablet support \u00b6 PerfectWORK has included native support for mobile phones and tablets. Menus are designed to flow and format properly. The new website application even includes a preview within the portal administration to emulate how the site would appear on a mobile phone.

We'll also include some handy tips and tricks for easily getting around the system and making the most out of your experience with PerfectWORK. Application \u00b6 Once you log in you'll be on PerfectWORK's main menu where applications, or Apps, are represented by icons. At first, you may not see very many apps installed. Each app adds new functions to the database and they're installed as needed. To get started with building out your database, you will need to install the necessary apps for your business needs. To do this, navigate to the Apps application by clicking its icon . Global Search Apps aren't listed in alphabetical order, but you can easily navigate to an app by simply typing its name from the main menu. As you type, the installed apps will filter as well as other related items. This is extremely useful when you have multiple apps installed. Clicking the Apps icon will take you to the app repository where you can browse around for the apps that you want to install. From this screen, you can see which apps your database has installed already and you can browse through the available apps to install. If you click on the button on any application, you can see the application's overview page to see if you would like to use it before installing. When you're ready to install an app, simply click the button and wait for the application to load. Please Note: For larger apps, this process could take several minutes. Once the app is installed, you will be routed to either the initial setup screen of the application to begin configuring it, or to your database's homepage where you can see your newly installed apps. Search \u00b6 The Search area is persistent in every application in PerfectWORK and provides the ability to easily find information. Search is a very straightforward feature and is tailored to the application you're using. For example, you won't be able to find a Sale Order from the search bar in the CRM app . By typing in the name of a customer, project, employee, or another object, you can retrieve that to view within the application that you're using. For the purposes of this document, we've highlighted an enhanced search feature in PerfectWORK that will make searching even easier. As you type in the search bar, you will see a dropdown menu appear with different options available to help you quickly locate your desired information. In this example, we've searched the Sales application for \"Peter\" and are looking for a client \"Peter Lim\". As you begin typing in the search bar, PerfectWORK gives the option to search specific customer within the Sales application for the desired keyword. Any option with the arrow \u2023 icon next to it can be expanded with a click, and PerfectWORK will display the available items for the data type that match your keyword. The example above shows the \"Customer\" section expanded and, as you can see, all customers with the keyword \"Peter\" in their profile are shown. From here you can either select the specific customer record you want to see, or you can select the option to display all customers with \"Peter\" in their profile. Filters \u00b6 Filters appear directly beneath the Search bar and allow you to customize the data that is displayed on a given page within any application in PerfectWORK. While the filters themselves will vary depending on what application you're using. For this example we will go over the basics of how to use filters in the Sales application. To get started, navigate to the Sales app. (If it's not installed, follow the instructions above to install it.) Once you've launched the Sales application, Select Orders \u2023 Customers let's take a look at the Search area at the top right of the screen. Toggle the Filters Menu If you do not see Filters or Group By or Favorites underneath the search bar, click the spyglass icon (with the + sign in it) and they will appear. If you want to hide them from view, click the spyglass icon (with - sign in it) and they will be hidden again. Click the Filters option to review the Filters menu. Let's now go over how to make the most of your Filters. When you review the Filters that are available within each application, the options will be specific to the data that's housed within that application. The Sales application is displayed for this example, so the options you see in the menu are specific to Sales data. There will typically be a set of default filters that are present in the dropdown menu for you to choose from. If you don't see the data that you want to view in the default filters, you can use the Add Custom Filter option to create your own filters. When adding a custom filter, you can set as many conditions as you'd like for the information you need to pull. When you add multiple conditions to the same custom filter, PerfectWORK automatically adds the \"or\" parameter to the search. So, if you want to search for customers who like Chocolate Icing OR Strawberry Icing, you would set the first condition, then click Add a Condition This opens a new section where you'll enter your \"or\" conditions. When you're done, click . After you select the filters that you want to use, PerfectWORK will automatically search the records in the model you\u2019re on for the information you've selected. Your filter will be reflected in the search bar. Saving a Custom Filter Custom filters, by default, will be lost once you leave the application that you're using. If you would like to save these custom filters for future use, then you'll need to utilize the Favorites feature, covered below, to accomplish this. Group By \u00b6 This feature allows you to change how your data is grouped together to better visualize your information and inform your workflows. For example, you may want to see your pipeline data grouped by Salesperson, so you can review which opportunities are being handled by which of your salespeople. This is just one small example of what this feature can do. Like the Filters function discussed above, the ways that PerfectWORK will allow you to group your data will depend on the application that you're using and the page that you're on within that application. Also, like the Filters option, you can use the Add Custom Group button to create your own groupings if the default options do not suit your needs. Unlike Filters, custom groupings will only allow you to add one parameter to a Custom Group; however, you may create multiple Custom Groups and apply them together. PerfectWORK will add the grouping methods to one another and group the data as you've specified. Saving a Custom Group Custom Groups, by default, will be lost once you leave the application that you're using. If you would like to save these custom Groups for use in the future, then you will need to use the Favorites feature, covered in the next section, to accomplish this. Favorites \u00b6 This feature allows you to save custom searches that you've built using the Filters and Group By options covered above. Once you have your search or grouping parameters configured and selected, click the Favorites dropdown menu, then click Save current search and the following window will appear. In this window, enter a name for your Search or Custom Group, choose whether or not you want the system to default to this search when you open the application, and if you'd like to share this search with all other users of this application. Once you have made your selections, click SAVE . After you've successfully saved your custom Search or Group to your Favorites, simply go to Favorites and select it from the dropdown menu to utilize them in the future. Deleting a Favoutite If you would like to delete any of your Favorites, you simply click the trash can next to the name of the Favorite you want to delete and then confirm the deletion. Views \u00b6 This feature is similar to Group By, but instead of changing how the information is grouped on the page, it will change the method by which all of the data is displayed. Think of changing your Group By method like re-arranging information on a pie chart, while changing a View is like moving from a pie chart to a line graph. PerfectWORK has several different Views that you can choose from. Not all of them are available in every application, but we will cover all of them in this document so that when you come across a View you will know what it does. You can find the different Views that are available within any application tucked under the Search bar at the top right. Each View is denoted by an icon. Available views will vary between Apps. We will be going through each one and will provide examples of how the Views look when selected. For the purposes of this article, we will be using the same data for every view so that you can see the ways that your data can be manipulated simply by changing a View. If you hover over each View's icon, you will see a tool-tip telling you the name of the View. Kanban \u00b6 This View will allow you to create a kanban board to view your data. Kanban is an organizational method that typically uses columns and cards to visualize data. As each project, task, or item moves through the kanban sequence from left to right, you can easily track where each item is in its lifecycle. The example below is from the Sales Pipeline within the CRM application. As you can see from the below screenshot, the Kanban View is selected from the View options and we have our Sales Pipeline organized by stages. Each column represents a different stage in the Sales process and you can see the Opportunities under each stage. You can always change the stage that an item is in by dragging and dropping it into the correct column. You can also re-organize the columns by dragging and dropping them to the appropriate placement within the process flow. To the far right, you also have the option to Add a Column to create a new Stage of the process flow. Once created, you can drag-and-drop to wherever you'd like within the Kanban view. Once your stages are set up, you can begin assigning items to them. List \u00b6 This View will organize your data into a list format. As you can see below, all of the same information from the Pipeline View is still present in our List view (e.g. Stage, Expected Revenue, Opportunity, and Customer) and some new information has become visible in this view (e.g. Probability and Created On). Some column headers will show an arrow on hover. This indicates that clicking that column header will sort it in either ascending or descending order, and clicking it again will reverse the sort order. Not all fields have this feature. Exposing Columns On the top-right of many different list views in PerfectWORK, you'll see the vertical ellipses icon. Clicking this icon allows you to expose other available columns. Because the data availability will change between apps and views, the options in this fly-out menu will also differ. Calendar \u00b6 This View allows you to see your Scheduled Activities in a calendar. You can see your upcoming events by the Day, Week, or Month. The calendar will only show items that are created under the Schedule Activity section for each item listed in our Sales Pipeline. As you can see from the screenshot below, the Calendar View is selected from the View options and the calendar is displayed by the Month. Pivot \u00b6 This View allows you to display your data in a Pivot Table. In the following example, the Pivot View is selected from the View menu. This displays our Sales Pipeline data in this format, showing the Expected Revenue for October at every Stage. Note that our table only displays October because that's when our sample database was created and there is no prior data. Graph \u00b6 This View allows you to create Graphs and visualize data points in four different ways: Pie Chart \u00b6 Bar Chart \u00b6 Line Chart \u00b6 To change the input data that gets used to create the different Graphs, click the MEASURE button and select the data that you would like to visualize from the dropdown menu. Activity \u00b6 This View allows you to see all of your upcoming Scheduled Activities for your tasks, clients, leads, opportunities, or any other element in your PerfectWORK applications. In the example below, we're in the CRM application so these are the scheduled activities in our Sales Pipeline for four different Opportunities. Each Opportunity has its own row and the dates of each scheduled activity shows in a column to the right. Activities in red are overdue, activities in orange are scheduled for today, and activities in green are scheduled for a time in the future. You can schedule additional activities by clicking the SCHEDULE AN ACTIVITY button at the bottom of the table. If you click on an Activity in the grid, you'll see what the Activity is, the scheduled date, and you can mark it as Done by clicking the checkmark icon that's greyed out on the right. You can also schedule additional activities for the row by clicking the SCHEDULE AN ACTIVITY button at the bottom of the pop-up. Actions \u00b6 This feature allows you to take specific actions on an object within PerfectWORK applications. This could be anything from setting up access to your system for your users, sending a customer an SMS message, or editing a customer record. To get started, navigate to the Contacts application. If you don't have this application installed, please do so now. When you click the Action menu, you will get a set of pre-determined actions that you can take to modify or interact with that object. These options will vary depending on the application that you're in, and what you are currently viewing or modifying. As you work in PerfectWORK, keep an eye out for the Action menu as it can be a great shortcut to what you're trying to do.","title":"Navigation - UI"},{"location":"01_application_guide/01_platform/01_getting_started/02_navigation/#application","text":"Once you log in you'll be on PerfectWORK's main menu where applications, or Apps, are represented by icons.

Another aspect that PerfectWORK puts forward or holds as a feature is the localization aspects of PerfectWORK, perhaps it can be said as the main and the best feature of PerfectWORK helping the business organization to run the business as per their region and country of functioning. With the localization element of the PerfectWORK platform, you will be able to define the taxes based on the country in that you operate in. The PerfectWORK Accounting module will help you to define the taxes and configure the various tax forms such as Sales tax, Purchase tax, Service tax, GST, VAT, Cess, and many more based on the region. The Accounting module of PerfectWORK has a distinctive menu window where these configurations can be configured. Another aspect that is regarded as the localization aspect is the currency in which the business is conducted and the PerfectWORK platform helps you with defining a base currency based on the country which is being selected upon the configuration of PerfectWORK. Furthermore, the PerfectWORK supports the operations of the business to run with multiple currencies which will be helpful for the functioning of multinational organizations. In addition, the invoice and bill generation will be based on the practices followed by the country or the region, and the companies functioning over there should be able to adapt to this methodology. With the PerfectWORK platform, you will be able to define the various constraints and attributes of the invoice and save them as templates to be further used in the future. The localization aspect can also be seen in other modules of PerfectWORK such as the purchase management module where the product description and purchases can be done based on the government norms and the authorization provided by the concerned authority regarding the purchase. Similar aspects can also be seen in the sales module of PerfectWORK where the companies functioning in a region will have to follow certain norms and conditions based on the region. The PerfectWORK purchase, as well as sales modules, will have distinctive configuration menus as well as options to help you to bring the localization on these aspects. The additional aspect of the localization element of PerfectWORK is the multi-language support of the platform helpful for multinational business organizations. You can bring in the operations of PerfectWORK to be functional in any language and the language settings can be easily changed based on your needs. Human resource management also has to be functional based on the localization aspects of the region. The PerfectWORK platform allows you to define the recruitment process and other HR operations as per the rules and regulations of the governing authorities of the region. The aspects such as working hours, employee's leave, paid leaves, and vacation are certain aspects that can be defined by you in PerfectWORK.

PerfectWORK sets up its own mail servers for your database. Outgoing and incoming emails work out-of-the-box! Unless you plan to send large batches of mass mailing that could require the use of an external mail server, simply enjoy your new PerfectWORK database. Scope of this documentation \u00b6 This document is mainly dedicated to PerfectWORK on-premise users who don\u2019t benefit from an out-of-the-box solution to send and receive emails in PerfectWORK, unlike PerfectWORK Online. Warning If no one in your company is used to manage email servers, we strongly recommend that you opt for those PerfectWORK hosting solutions. Their email system works instantly and is monitored by professionals. Nevertheless you can still use your own email servers if you want to manage your email server\u2019s reputation yourself. You will find here some useful information on how to integrate your own email solution with PerfectWORK. Note Office 365 email servers don\u2019t easily allow to send external emails from hosts like PerfectWORK. Refer to Microsoft\u2019s documentation to make it work. How to manage outbound messages \u00b6 As a system admin, go to Settings \u2023 General Settings and check External Email Servers . Then, click Outgoing Mail Servers to create one and reference the SMTP data of your email server. Once all the information has been filled out, click on Test Connection . Here is a typical configuration for a G Suite server. Then set your email domain name in the General Settings. Note If you get a [AUTHENTICATIONFAILED] Invalid credentials (Failure) warning when you Test Connection on a Gmail address, activate the Less secure app access option. A direct link can be accessed here. In addition to that, enable the IMAP setting on your Gmail account. Can I use an Office 365 server \u00b6 You can use an Office 365 server if you run PerfectWORK on-premise. Office 365 SMTP relays are not compatible with PerfectWORK Online unless you configure PerfectWORK to force the outgoing \u201cFrom\u201d address . Please refer to Microsoft\u2019s documentation to configure a SMTP relay for your PerfectWORK\u2019s IP address. How to use a G Suite server \u00b6 You can use an G Suite server for any PerfectWORK hosting type. To do so you need to setup the SMTP relay service. The configuration steps are explained in Google documentation. Restriction \u00b6 Please note that port 25 is blocked for security reasons on our PerfectWORK Online platform. Try using 465 or 587. Use a default \u201cFrom\u201d email address \u00b6 Sometimes, an email\u2019s \u201cFrom\u201d (outgoing) address can belong to a different domain, and that can be a problem. For example, if a customer with address mary@customer.example.com responds to a message, PerfectWORK will try to redistribute that same email to other subscribers in the thread. But if the domain customer.example.com forbids that kind of usage for security, the PerfectWORK\u2019s redistributed email would get rejected by some recipients\u2019 mail servers. To avoid those kind of problems, you should make sure all emails use a \u201cFrom\u201d address from your authorized domain. If your MTA supports SRS (Sender Rewriting Scheme), you can enable it to handle these situations. However, that is more complex and requires more technical knowledge that is not meant to be covered by this documentation. Instead, you can also configure PerfectWORK to do something similar by itself: Set your domain name in the General Settings. Click on Outgoing Mail Servers Create a new one. Fill its From Filter. Use a domain (such as mycompany.example.com) to keep the original \u201cFrom\u201d address for mails that come from that domain. Use an address (such as outgoing@mycompany.example.com ) to allow only that outgoing address. Keep it empty to use this server for any email address. With this configuration in place, if PerfectWORK sends an email that doesn\u2019t match any of the from filters, it will alter the email\u2019s \u201cFrom\u201d before sending it to the MTA. It will use the default outgoing email address, composed like this: {mail.default.from}@{mail.catchall.domain}. In developer mode, go to Settings \u2023 Technical \u2023 Parameters \u2023 System Parameters. Add these system parameters: mail.default.from: local part of default outgoing email address. mail.catchall.domain: domain part of default outgoing email address. How to manage inbound messages \u00b6 PerfectWORK relies on generic email aliases to fetch incoming messages. Reply messages of messages sent from PerfectWORK are routed to their original discussion thread (and to the inbox of all its followers) by the catchall alias (catchall@). Bounced messages are routed to bounce@ in order to track them in PerfectWORK. This is especially used in PerfectWORK Email Marketing to opt-out invalid recipients. Original messages : Several business objects have their own alias to create new records in PerfectWORK from incoming emails: Sales Channel (to create Leads or Opportunities in PerfectWORK CRM), Support Channel (to create Tickets in PerfectWORK Helpdesk), Projects (to create new Tasks in PerfectWORK Project), Job Positions (to create Applicants in PerfectWORK Recruitment), etc. Depending on your mail server, there might be several methods to fetch emails. The easiest and most recommended method is to manage one email address per PerfectWORK alias in your mail server. Create the corresponding email addresses in your mail server (catchall@, bounce@, sales@, etc.). Set your domain name in the General Settings. If you use PerfectWORK on-premise, create an Incoming Mail Server in PerfectWORK for each alias. You can do it from the General Settings as well. Fill out the form according to your email provider\u2019s settings. Leave the Actions to Perform on Incoming Mails blank. Once all the information has been filled out, click on TEST & CONFIRM . If you use PerfectWORK Online or PerfectWORK.sh, We do recommend to redirect incoming messages to PerfectWORK\u2019s domain name rather than exclusively use your own email server. That way you will receive incoming messages without delay. Indeed, PerfectWORK Online is fetching incoming messages of external servers once per hour only. You should set redirections for all the email addresses to PerfectWORK\u2019s domain name in your email server (e.g. catchall@mydomain.ext to catchall@mycompany.PerfectWORK.com ). Tip All the aliases are customizable in PerfectWORK . Object aliases can be edited from their respective configuration view. To edit catchall and bounce aliases, you first need to activate the developer mode. Then go to Settings \u2023 Technical \u2023 Parameters \u2023 System Parameters to customize the aliases (mail.catchall.alias & * mail.bounce.alias*). Note By default inbound messages are fetched every 5 minutes in PerfectWORK on-premise. You can change this value in developer mode. Go to Settings \u2023 Technical \u2023 Automation \u2023 Scheduled Actions and look for Mail: Fetchmail Service . Set up different dedicated servers for transactional and mass mails \u00b6 PerfectWORK is subject to a daily email limit to prevent abuse. However, if needed, you can use a separate Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) servers for transactional e-mails and mass mailings. Example: use PerfectWORK\u2019s own mail server for transactional e-mails, and Sendgrid, Amazon SES, or Mailgun for mass mailings. Another alternative is to use Postmark for transactional e-mails, and Amazon SES or Sendgrid for mass mailings. Note A default outgoing email server is already configured. You should not create an alternative one unless you want to use a specific external outgoing email server for technical reasons. To do this, you should first activate the developer mode and then go to Settings \u2023 Technical \u2023 Outgoing e-mail servers. There you have to create two e-mail MTA server settings. One for transactional e-mails and one for mass mail servers. Be sure to mark the priority of transactional e-mail servers as low as the mass email servers. Now, go to Email Marketing \u2023 Settings and enable Dedicated Server. With these settings, PerfectWORK uses the server with the lower priority for transactional emails, and the server here selected for mass mails. Note that in this case, you have to set your domain\u2019s Sender Policy Framework (SPF) records to include both transactional and mass mail servers. If your server resides with xxxx.PerfectWORK.com, the available options are Sendinblue and Mailchimp, as your e-mails would be originated from the xxxx.PerfectWORK.app domain. Sending emails with PerfectWORK \u00b6 Using your email domain in PerfectWORK \u00b6 Documents in PerfectWORK (a CRM opportunity, a sales order, an invoice \u2026) have a discussion thread, called chatter. When you post a message in the chatter, this message is sent by email to the followers of the document. If a follower replies to the message, the reply updates the chatter, and PerfectWORK relays the reply to the followers. Emails from your users to partners (customers, vendors) are sent from the email address of your users. Similarly, emails from partners to users are sent from the email address of the partners. This allows you to recognize at a glance who sent an email relayed by PerfectWORK. If your database is hosted on our cloud (PerfectWORK Online), it is not necessary to add an outgoing email server to send emails from your custom domain. You can enjoy this feature by using the default PerfectWORK email server. Important The PerfectWORK server is subject to a daily email limit to prevent abuse. The default limit is 200 emails sent per day for databases with an subscription. This limit can be increased under certain conditions. See our FAQ or contact support for more information. However, it is recommended that you configure your domain name to ensure that emails from your users reach your partners, rather than being considered spam. For the same reason, we recommend that you always give your users an email address from a domain you manage, rather than a generic email address (gmail.com, outlook.com, etc.). Be SPF compliant \u00b6 The Sender Policy Framework (SPF) protocol allows the owner of a domain name to specify which servers are allowed to send email from that domain. When a server receives an incoming email, it checks whether the IP address of the sending server is on the list of allowed IPs according to the SPF record of the sender. Note The SPF verification is performed on the domain mentioned in the Return-Path field of the email. In the case of an email sent by PerfectWORK, this domain corresponds to the value of the mail.catchall.domain key in the database system parameters. See the documentation on incoming emails. The SPF policy of a domain is set using a TXT record. How to create or modify a TXT record depends on the provider hosting the DNS zone of your domain name. In order for the verification to work properly, each domain can only have one SPF record. If your domain name does not yet have an SPF record, the content of the record to create is as follows: v=spf1 include:_spf.PerfectWORK.com ~all If your domain name already has an SPF record, you need to update this record (and do not create a new one). Example If your TXT record is v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all, you need to edit it to add include: _spf.perfectwork.app : v=spf1 include:_spf.perfectwork.app include:_spf.google.com ~~all You can check if your SPF record is valid with a free tool like MXToolbox SPF . Enable DKIM \u00b6 The DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) allows you to authenticate your emails with a digital signature. When sending an email, the PerfectWORK server includes a unique DKIM signature in the headers. The recipient\u2019s server decrypts this signature using the DKIM record in your domain name. If the signature and the key contained in the record match, this guarantees that your message is authentic and has not been altered during transport. To enable DKIM, you must add a CNAME record to the DNS zone of your domain name: PerfectWORK._domainkey IN CNAME PerfectWORK._domainkey.PerfectWORK.app. Tip If your domain name is mycompany.com, you need to create a subdomain PerfectWORK._domainkey.mycompany.com whose canonical name is PerfectWORK._domainkey.PerfectWORK.app. How to create or modify a CNAME record depends on the provider hosting the DNS zone of your domain name. The most common providers are list below. You can check if your DKIM record is valid with a free tool like DKIM Core. If a selector is asked, enter PerfectWORK. Check your DMARC policy \u00b6 The Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance (DMARC) is a protocol that unifies SPF and DKIM. The instructions contained in the DMARC record of a domain name tell the destination server what to do with an incoming email that fails the SPF and/or DKIM check. There are three DMARC policies: - p=none - p=quarantine - p=reject p=quarantine and p=reject instruct the server that receives an email to quarantine that email or ignore it if the SPF and/or DKIM check fails. If your domain name uses DMARC and has defined one of these policies, it is therefore imperative to be SPF compliant or to enable DKIM. Danger Yahoo or AOL are examples of email providers with a DMARC policy set to p=reject. We strongly advise against using an @yahoo .com or @aol .com address for your users. These emails will never reach their recipient. p=none is used for the domain owner to receive reports about entities using their domain. It should not impact the deliverability if the DMARC check fails. You can check the DMARC record of a domain name with a tool like MXToolbox DMARC . If one of your partners, customer or vendor, uses DMARC and has defined one of these policies, the PerfectWORK server cannot relay emails from this partner to your users. You need to handle user notifications in PerfectWORK, or replace the email address of the partner with a default email address. Use a default email address \u00b6 To force the email address from which emails are sent, you need to create the following key in the System Parameters of the database: If mail.default.from is set, and contains a full email address, all outgoing emails are sent from the given address. This is a requirement to use Outlook with PerfectWORK. You access the System Parameters in developer mode in the Settings \u2023 Technical \u2023 Parameters \u2023 System Parameters menu. Email Templates \u00b6 We all know writing good emails is vital to get a high response rate, but you do not want to rewrite the same structure every time, do you? That is where email templates come in. Without the need to rewrite the entire email structure every time, you save time to focus on the content. Multiple templates also let you deliver the right message to the right audience, improving their overall experience with the company. Note The email templates use QWeb. The composer allows you to edit emails in their final rendering, making customizations more robust as you don\u2019t have to edit code. Defining a default reply to on your mail template \u00b6 Although the field reply to is available within the mail templates, this field is only used for mass mailing mode (this means when sending templates on what we call bulk emailing). You can send emails in bulk in almost every app that has a list view. Select the records you want and click on the action button. If you have an option to send an email, you will see a mail composer with possible values to define: You can also define them by default on the template: Because of this, setting a value in this field is useless as the value defined will be totally ignored. The default reply-to value is the default catchall email address to ensure a communication between your customer and your PerfectWORK database. For more information about the way the catchall works, please check how to manage inbound messages. Transactional emails and corresponding URL for each company \u00b6 When using PerfectWORK, multiple events trigger the sending of automated emails. These emails are known as transactional emails and sometimes contain links pointing to your PerfectWORK database. By default, links generated by the database use the dynamic web.base.url key defined in the system parameters. More information about this parameter. If the website application isn\u2019t installed, the web.base.url key will always be the default parameter used to generate all the links. It\u2019s important to know that this key can only have a single value, meaning that in a multi-website/company database environment, even if you have a specific domain name for each website, the links generated to share a document or within a transactional email might remain the same, whatever the website/company related to the sending of the email/document. This is not always the case as some PerfectWORK applications have a link established in the database with the website application, meaning that in this case, if a specific domain is defined for the websites, the URL generated in the email template will use the domain defined on the corresponding website of the company. Caution A document shared using the documents application will always use the web.base.url key, as the document shared isn\u2019t associated with any particular website. Meaning that the URL will always be the same (the web.base.url key value), whatever the company it\u2019s shared from, this is a known limitation! On the other hand, sales orders made by a customer on one of your PerfectWORK e-commerce websites have a link established with the website from which the order was made. As a result, the e-mail sent for the sales orders uses the domain name defined for the corresponding website to generate the links. For more information about how to configure your domains, we invite you to check our domain name documentation. Updating translations within email templates \u00b6 Email templates are automatically translated. Changing the translations shouldn\u2019t be necessary. However, if for a specific reason you\u2019d like to change some of the translations, this can be done. Like any modification in the code, keep in mind that modifications that aren\u2019t done correctly (for example modifications leading to bad syntax) can break the template, as a result, the template will appear blank. In order to edit your translations, follow these steps from the template. Click on the edit button, then on the language button Edit the language of a template A pop-up window with the different languages installed on the database will be displayed. From here, editing the translations will be possible. Don\u2019t forget to hit the save button to preserve your changes. FAQ \u00b6 This document contains an explanation of the most recurring mailing concerns. We will start by addressing issues of outgoing emails (ex: my client has not received my email), and then, of incoming emails (ex: I do not receive responses from my customers in the database). Outgoing emails \u00b6 What do you have to check if your email is not sent? \u00b6 The first indicator showing you that the email has not been sent is the red envelope next to the date and time of the message. Common error messages \u00b6 You reached your daily limit: Warning in PerfectWORK upon email limit reached Each email service provider has its own email sending limits. The limits may be daily, hourly, and sometimes even per minute. This is the same for PerfectWORK, we have to limit our customers to prevent our e-mail servers from being blacklisted. Here are the default limits for new databases: 200 emails/day for PerfectWORK Online and PerfectWORK.sh databases with an active subscription, 50 emails/day for one-app free and trial databases, in case of migration, your daily limit might be reset to 50 emails a day. In case you hit the limit, you can: Ask our support team to increase your daily limit. We will analyze the situation of your database depending on (non-exhaustive list): How many users in your database, Which apps are installed, Your bounce rate: the percentage of email addresses that did not receive your emails because it was returned by a mail server on its way to the final recipient. You can contact the support. Use your own outgoing email server to be independent of PerfectWORK\u2019s mail limit (please refer to the corresponding documentation), Wait until 11pm UTC for the reset and click on the retry button: The Developer mode must be activated. Then, go to Settings \u2023 Technical \u2023 Emails Warning The daily limit is global to your database and can rise quickly! By default an internal message, a notification, a note, etc. counts as an email in your daily limit if it notifies someone. You can mitigate this by receiving your notifications in PerfectWORK instead of by emails. SMTP Error \u00b6 You can find out why an email wasn\u2019t transmitted successfully by reviewing the Simple Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP) error messages. SMTP is a protocol to describe the email structure and transmit it over the Internet, and the error messages generated by email services are helpful tools to diagnose and troubleshoot email problems. No Error \u00b6 PerfectWORK is not always capable of providing information for the reason it failed. The different providers implement a personalized policy of the bounce emails and it is not always possible for PerfectWORK to interpret it correctly. If you have this problem on a recurring basis with the same client or the same domain, please do not hesitate to contact PerfectWORK Support for help in finding a reason. Note: in such case, one of the most common reasons is related to SPF and/or DKIM configuration. Why is my email sent late? \u00b6 It may happen that you schedule an email campaign but it is not sent on time. We know that we use a delayed job to send emails that we consider as not urgent (Newsletters concept such as mass mailing, marketing automation, events). The system utility cron can be used to schedule programs to run automatically at predetermined intervals. We use that policy in order to avoid cluttering the mail servers and prioritize the communication. The emails considered urgent (communication from one person to another one such as Sales Orders, Invoices, Purchase Orders, etc.) are sent directly. By default, the Mass Mailing cron runs every 60 minutes. So, you should wait maximum an hour before the campaign is actually sent. Incoming emails \u00b6 When you have an issue with incoming emails, there might not be an indication per se in PerfectWORK. This is the client who tries to contact a database who will get a bounce (most of the time 550: mailbox unavailable). Emails are not received \u00b6 Depending on the platform you are using: Get help from support \u00b6 In order to get helped efficiently, please provide as much information as possible. Here is a list of what can be helpful: The EML of the email, stating for Electronic Mail, is the file format containing all the technical information required for an investigation. The documentation of your own email provider might help you on how to get your EML files. Once you get the EML of the email, adding it in the attachment of your ticket is the most efficient way for us to investigate. The support will mainly focus on redundant issues. The exact flow you are following in order to normally receive those emails in PerfectWORK. Here are examples of questions whose answers can be useful: Is this simply a reply from an email going out from PerfectWORK ? Are you using an incoming email server or somehow redirecting? Can you provide us with an example of an email that has been correctly forwarded ? Providing answers to the following questions: Is it a generic issue or is it specific to a use case? If yes, which one exactly? Is it working as expected? In case the email is sent using PerfectWORK, the bounce email should reach the PerfectWORK database and display the red envelope.","title":"Email Communication"},{"location":"01_application_guide/01_platform/03_connect/02_email_communication/#send-and-receive-emails-in-perfectwork-with-an-email-server","text":"","title":"Send and Receive Emails in PerfectWORK with an Email Server"},{"location":"01_application_guide/01_platform/03_connect/02_email_communication/#if-you-are-a-user-of-perfectwork-online","text":"You have nothing to do!

One for transactional e-mails and one for mass mail servers. Be sure to mark the priority of transactional e-mail servers as low as the mass email servers. Now, go to Email Marketing \u2023 Settings and enable Dedicated Server. With these settings, PerfectWORK uses the server with the lower priority for transactional emails, and the server here selected for mass mails. Note that in this case, you have to set your domain\u2019s Sender Policy Framework (SPF) records to include both transactional and mass mail servers. If your server resides with xxxx.PerfectWORK.com, the available options are Sendinblue and Mailchimp, as your e-mails would be originated from the xxxx.PerfectWORK.app domain.","title":"Set up different dedicated servers for transactional and mass mails"},{"location":"01_application_guide/01_platform/03_connect/02_email_communication/#sending-emails-with-perfectwork","text":"","title":"Sending emails with PerfectWORK"},{"location":"01_application_guide/01_platform/03_connect/02_email_communication/#using-your-email-domain-in-perfectwork","text":"Documents in PerfectWORK (a CRM opportunity, a sales order, an invoice \u2026) have a discussion thread, called chatter.

If a follower replies to the message, the reply updates the chatter, and PerfectWORK relays the reply to the followers. Emails from your users to partners (customers, vendors) are sent from the email address of your users. Similarly, emails from partners to users are sent from the email address of the partners. This allows you to recognize at a glance who sent an email relayed by PerfectWORK.

You can enjoy this feature by using the default PerfectWORK email server. Important The PerfectWORK server is subject to a daily email limit to prevent abuse. The default limit is 200 emails sent per day for databases with an subscription. This limit can be increased under certain conditions. See our FAQ or contact support for more information. However, it is recommended that you configure your domain name to ensure that emails from your users reach your partners, rather than being considered spam.

Note The SPF verification is performed on the domain mentioned in the Return-Path field of the email. In the case of an email sent by PerfectWORK, this domain corresponds to the value of the mail.catchall.domain key in the database system parameters. See the documentation on incoming emails. The SPF policy of a domain is set using a TXT record. How to create or modify a TXT record depends on the provider hosting the DNS zone of your domain name. In order for the verification to work properly, each domain can only have one SPF record. If your domain name does not yet have an SPF record, the content of the record to create is as follows: v=spf1 include:_spf.PerfectWORK.com ~all If your domain name already has an SPF record, you need to update this record (and do not create a new one). Example If your TXT record is v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all, you need to edit it to add include: _spf.perfectwork.app : v=spf1 include:_spf.perfectwork.app include:_spf.google.com ~~all You can check if your SPF record is valid with a free tool like MXToolbox SPF .","title":"Be SPF compliant"},{"location":"01_application_guide/01_platform/03_connect/02_email_communication/#enable-dkim","text":"The DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) allows you to authenticate your emails with a digital signature.

If the signature and the key contained in the record match, this guarantees that your message is authentic and has not been altered during transport. To enable DKIM, you must add a CNAME record to the DNS zone of your domain name: PerfectWORK._domainkey IN CNAME PerfectWORK._domainkey.PerfectWORK.app. Tip If your domain name is mycompany.com, you need to create a subdomain PerfectWORK._domainkey.mycompany.com whose canonical name is PerfectWORK._domainkey.PerfectWORK.app. How to create or modify a CNAME record depends on the provider hosting the DNS zone of your domain name.

There are three DMARC policies: - p=none - p=quarantine - p=reject p=quarantine and p=reject instruct the server that receives an email to quarantine that email or ignore it if the SPF and/or DKIM check fails. If your domain name uses DMARC and has defined one of these policies, it is therefore imperative to be SPF compliant or to enable DKIM. Danger Yahoo or AOL are examples of email providers with a DMARC policy set to p=reject. We strongly advise against using an @yahoo .com or @aol .com address for your users.

A strong and deep-rooted accounting and bookkeeping system are essential for a smooth business. In this process of keeping track of a business\u2019s financial status, the accounting system initiates with the practice of bookkeeping. It then concludes with reporting data and information as a financial statement at the end of every financial year. Accounting has a pivotal role in successfully evaluating business performance. You can easily compare accounts with previous years. The accounting system also lets you keep a close look at the cash flow by having a robust book of accounts. In addition, the account-keeping system offers you effortless filing and always allows you to stay compliant. Apart from all these benefits, the Accounting data makes it easy to formulate the budget to fulfill a consigned business strategy. So you can efficiently and effectively budget for your future plans. Proper accounting supports the organization by offering it with various financial reports required for handling day-to-day business operations.

The accurate records gained from the financial accounts will help you make the right decision for the business, resulting in effective management and higher profitability. Double Entry Bookkeeping System \u00b6 Double-entry bookkeeping in accounting is a system of recording transactions. In this system, the entry is recorded as at least two accounts: debit and credit. In this system, the debit and credit amounts recorded must be balanced. This means the amount of the recorded debits must equal the amount recorded as credits. So the system will help you to record the transaction on two sides. In this system, when a transaction occurs and gets impacted in an account, a matched impact will occur in the other account. The corresponding debit value will be recorded for the credit value. In addition, the credited and debited accounts will be listed in the company chart of accounts. When considering an example, suppose a sale is confirmed for $ 200. There will be an impact on both the Income Account and the Receivable Account. Since it is a sale for the organization, the income increases. So the income increases and the income account credits $200. As Assets increase and as result, the receivable account debits $200. The nature of the account will decide whether an account should be credited or debited. The hierarchy of Accounting \u00b6 Finance is the fundamental element for future success. So as a business leader, you must be bothered about the accounting hierarchy of your business or organization. The accounting hierarchy is very important without considering the size and type of business.

Assets represent the company's wealth and the goods it owns. Fixed assets include buildings and offices, while current assets include bank accounts and cash.The money owed by a client is an asset. An employee is not an asset. Liabilities are obligations from past events that the company will have to pay in the future (utility bills, debts, unpaid suppliers). Liabilities could also be defined as a source of financing which is provided to the company, also called *leverage*. Equity is the amount of the funds contributed by the owners of the company (founders or shareholders) plus previously retained earnings (or losses). Each year, net profits (or losses) may be reported as retained earnings or distributed to the shareholders (as a dividend). What is owned (an asset) has been financed through debts to reimburse (liabilities) or equity (profits, capital). A difference is made between assets and expenses : An asset is a resource with economic value that an individual, corporation, or country owns or controls with the expectation that it will provide a future benefit. Assets are reported on a company's balance sheet. They are bought or created to increase a firm's value or benefit its operations. An expense is the costs of operations a company bears to generate revenues. The profit and loss (P&L) report shows the company's performance over a specific period of time, usually a quarter or a fiscal year. The revenue refers to the money earned by the company by selling goods and/or services. The cost of goods sold (COGS, or also known as \"Cost of Sale\") refers to the sale of goods' costs (e.g., the cost of the materials and labor used to create the goods). The Gross profit equals the revenues from sales minus the cost of goods sold. Operating expenses (OPEX) include administration, sales and R&D salaries, rent and utilities, miscellaneous costs, insurances, and anything beyond the costs of products sold or the cost of sale. Chart of Accounts \u00b6 The chart of accounts lists all the company's accounts: both Balance sheet accounts and P&L accounts. Every transaction is recorded by debiting and crediting multiple accounts in a journal entry. In a way, a chart of accounts is like a company's DNA! Every account listed in the chart of accounts belongs to a specific category. In PerfectWORK, each account has a unique code and belongs to one of these categories: Equity and subordinated debts Equity is the amount of money invested by a company's shareholders to finance the company's activities. Subordinated debts are the amount of money lent by a third party to a company to finance its activities. In the event of the dissolution of a company, these third parties are reimbursed before the shareholders. Fixed assets are tangible (i.e., physical) items or properties that a company purchases and uses to produce its goods and services. Fixed assets are long-term assets. This means the assets have a useful life of more than one year. They also include properties, plants, and equipments (also known as \"PP&E\") and are recorded on the balance sheet with that classification. Current assets and liabilities The current assets account is a balance sheet line item listed under the Assets section, which accounts for all company-owned assets that can be converted to cash within one year. Current assets include cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, stock inventory, marketable securities, prepaid liabilities, and other liquid assets. Current liabilities are a company's short-term financial obligations due within one year. An example of a current liability is money owed to suppliers in the form of accounts payable. Bank and cash accounts A bank account is a financial account maintained by a bank or other financial institution in which the financial transactions between the bank and a customer are recorded. A cash account , or cash book, may refer to a ledger in which all cash transactions are recorded. The cash account includes both the cash receipts and the cash payment journals. Expenses and income An expense is the costs of operations a company bears to generate revenues. It is simply defined as the cost one is required to spend on obtaining something. Common expenses include supplier payments, employee wages, factory leases, and equipment depreciation. The term \" income \" generally refers to the amount of money, property, and other transfers of value received over a set period of time in exchange for services or products.","title":"More Info on Accounting"},{"location":"01_application_guide/20_accounting/01_accounting_concept/01_notes_accounting/#chart-of-accounts","text":"The chart of accounts lists all the company's accounts: both Balance sheet accounts and P&L accounts.

The term \" income \" generally refers to the amount of money, property, and other transfers of value received over a set period of time in exchange for services or products.","title":"Chart of Accounts"},{"location":"01_application_guide/20_accounting/01_accounting_concept/02_account_group/","text":"Account Groups are the aggregation of similar ledger accounts into a single group. These account groups are intended to demonstrate the hierarchy of ledger accounts. This hierarchy of ledger accounts will be very useful for generating appropriate reporting. The generally used account groups in PerfectWORK are Regular, Payable, Receivable, and Liquidity. Each of these account ledgers is described under the defined groups: Sl.No Account Name Nature Group Under Affect in Reports 1 Receivable Asset Receivable Balance Sheet 2 Bank and Cash Asset Liquidity Balance Sheet 3 Current Assets Asset Regular Balance Sheet 4 Non-Current Assets Asset Regular Balance Sheet 5 Prepayments Asset Regular Balance Sheet 6 Fixed Assets Asset Regular Balance Sheet 7 Payable Liability Payable Balance sheet 8 Credit Card Liability Liquidity Balance sheet 9 Current Liabilities Liability Regular Balance sheet 10 Non-Current liabilities Liability Regular Balance sheet 11 Equity Equity Regular Balance sheet 12 Current Year Earnings Equity Regular Balance sheet 13 Income Income Regular Profit & Loss 14 Other Income Income Regular Profit & Loss 15 Expenses Expense Regular Profit & Loss 16 Depreciation Expense Regular Profit & Loss 17 Cost of Revenue Expense Regular Profit & Loss Let us have a look at each of them. Receivables (Debtors) \u00b6 Account Receivables can be defined as the amount of money needed to pay for products or services received but not yet paid. The receivables are also known as debtors. These accounts are very convenient for registering all the receivables from the side of customers. When we consider the nature of the receivables, they will come under the Assets. Considering a Sale, based upon the increasing of receivables, the receivable accounts get debited. Bank and Cash \u00b6 The nature of the Bank and Cash type is Asset, and every bank and cash account of the organization will come under the Bank and Cash type. To give an example, suppose an organization forms a cash payment in favor of a credit purchase and considers the amount that gets transferred from the bank account. The bank account will be credited since the asset decreases. Current Assets \u00b6 Current assets are the cash and other assets that are expected to be converted to cash within one year. So this account type will be very advantageous for recording short-term assets. The assets like inventory, short-term investments, prepaid expenses, etc., can be considered in this type. The bank deposits, loans, and advances offered to the employees come under this category. Stock valuation accounts, Stock input accounts, Stock Output Accounts, Deferred Expense Accounts, and many more are General accounts. Ledgers of type \u2018Current Assets\u2019 used in PerfectWORK and the entries of this type affect the Balance Sheet since its nature is an asset. Non-Current Assets \u00b6 The non-current assets are considered as an asset that the organization obtains or invests. However, the amount of that investment does not revert within an accounting year. So this investment type will bear for a long time, and this extensive type cannot be simply liquidated into cash. Examples of this type of asset are buildings, vehicles, insurance, etc. The total esteem can not be calculated within the accounting year. All of them are listed in the balance sheet. Prepayments \u00b6 Prepayments can be illustrated as prepaid expenses. In this case, the cost has already occurred for the products and services, but they are not to be received yet consumed. When taking an example, PerfectWORK considered Deferred Expenses or Prepaid expenses as this type. For example, if there is insurance with a payment of $ 24000 for one year. The organization will not be able to enter the whole expense in the profit and loss report for the current year. The organization must divide the amount over one year. So 200$ will be consumed monthly, and the expense will be posted. The payment will be of the \u2018Asset\u2019 nature, and the asset will decrease each year. As a result, the payment account will get credited, and the expense account will get debited just as the expense gradually decreases. Fixed Assets \u00b6 The Fixed Assets account type is very comfortable for capturing the details of every fixed asset transaction, such as machinery, vehicles, land, buildings, furniture, and many more. We can include all the items the company or business aims to use for a long period. Further, the fixed assets come under the Assets nature. Because when we purchase, the fixed asset will increase, the fixed asset account will debit, and the fixed assets will be listed in the balance sheet. Payables (Creditors) \u00b6 The Payables account type is also known as Creditors. It is the total unpaid amount of an organization to any individual or anyone. The payable accounts are suitable for keeping a record of every payable amount to the suppliers or vendors. In addition, the payable account is credited as the type of liability on a vendor bill. Credit Cards \u00b6 Credit Card is also a type of account, and the nature of the account is Liability. The credit card is documented on the balance sheet. In the case of credit cards, the amount of money expended using the credit card for any purpose, such as a purchase or any other payment for other expenses through the credit card, will cause some debts, and we should refund within a period of time, almost less than two months or close to. Current Liabilities \u00b6 Current liabilities can be termed as short-term liabilities, which are supposed to be settled within a year. The following categories can be listed under the Current liability account type. Which are bank overdrafts, short-term loans, taxes and duties, salary payables, payroll taxes, accrued expenses, income taxes, and much more. Non-current liabilities \u00b6 Non-current liabilities are long-term liabilities that can be referred to as long-period debts or financial commitments that are due a year or more and are listed on the balance sheet. Long-term loans, deferred tax liabilities, long-term lease obligations, and pension benefit obligations are some examples of non-current liabilities. Equity \u00b6 Equity account type can be considered as the financial depiction of the proprietary of an organization or business. It represents the amount of money the employers endowed for initiation and initial functioning. Equity can arise from the payments to a business from the owners' side or the residual earnings formed by a business. In other words, we can say that Equity is an amount of assets when every liability is settled and listed in the balance sheet. Common stock, contributed surplus, treasury stock, common and preferred stocks, other extensive earnings, etc., come under this account type. When we consider the nature of equity, it will come under Asset type. The equity will be directly proportional to the invested money. That means equity will increase when any investor invests money in that. As a result, the capital account will be credited with the increased equity. Current year earnings \u00b6 The \u2018Current Year Yearning\u201d account type belongs to the equity-based account type that represents the net profit and loss for the current fiscal year for balance sheet purposes. If the sales or any other transaction has impacted on the income and expense account, the current year's earnings will also be affected. This will also be listed in the balance sheet. Income & Other Income \u00b6 The Income & Other Income account type is very beneficial for the business to demonstrate company\u2019s income or revenue. The account's nature is income, which will be recorded under the profit and loss reports. The profit from the company's core business activities (selling of products and services) is considered as the Income, and the other income is not the direct revenues. Examples of other income are the interest amount, rent amount, etc. Expenses \u00b6 Expenses accounts are the account types that record all the details of the amount an organization expenses on everyday costs during an assigned accounting period. This expense account type includes delivery expenses, income tax expenses, expenses for the production of goods and services, salary expenses, advertising expenses, repairs expenses, promotion expenses, rent expenses, etc. come under this category. The nature of the Expenses accounts type is surely expense, and it will be listed under the income statement/profit and loss report. Depreciation \u00b6 The Depreciation account types are commonly referred to as the amount that an organization's assets are depreciated for a single period. Normally, this account type is used for recording fixed asset depreciation. In the case of Fixed assets, some depreciation will be noted occasionally, and certainly, the value of fixed assets will decrease in each period. So this type of depreciation will be linear or digressive. Also, there will be a book value and the salvage value at the time of asset creation. The book value stands for the original cost. In the case of Salvage value, it is the amount that the organization will obtain the moment when selling that fixed assets after all the depreciations are expensed. Further, the expense will be divided over a certain period rather than including the overall expenses to the current year based on the depreciation method applied. So the depreciation accounts debit an expense account credit. Cost of Revenue \u00b6 The cost of revenue is directly related to the direct expenses generated with the goods and services offered by the company. Which means it is the total cost of manufacturing and delivering a product or service to its customers. It is directly associated with the income statement, so it is more comfortable to represent the direct cost related with the goods and services. It includes the manufacturing cost of the product and the cost of delivering them to the customers. The nature of this account type (Cost of revenue) is the expense, and the account type will impact on the gross profit. Account Ledgers \u00b6 An Account ledger is nothing but an account or record capable of managing bookkeeping entries for balance sheet and income statement transactions, such as opening and closing balance in debit or credit. This type of book or digital record encompasses bookkeeping entries and detailed transaction information, including routine business operations such as a bank or cash transactions, stock valuation, invoicing customers, vendor invoices records, salary expenses, and many more. The ledgers include all the essential information required for preparing financial statements. Every transaction has a reference number that will be advantageous to them to determine why and how that specific transaction was done. Different account ledgers used in PerfectWORK are as follows: Income account Expense account Stock input account Stock output account Stock valuation account Price difference account Account Receivable Account Payable Fixed Asset Account Depreciation Account Revenue Account Deferred revenue account Expense account Deferred Expense Account Suspense Account Outstanding Receipts Account Outstanding Payments Account Transfer Accounts","title":"Account Groups"},{"location":"01_application_guide/20_accounting/01_accounting_concept/02_account_group/#receivables-debtors","text":"Account Receivables can be defined as the amount of money needed to pay for products or services received but not yet paid.

With PerfectWORK Accounting, you will be able to view pre-configured journals that are suitable for almost all industries. Also, the platform allows you to define new journals if required. Here in the PerfectWORK platform, you have five types of journals for the purpose of listing the same sort of transaction in one single journal. When we list the five journals in PerfectWORK, this can be listed as Sales Purchase Bank Cash Miscellaneous Sales Journal \u00b6 The Sales journal type records every single sales-related transaction. The PerfectWORK platform allows you to configure multiple sales journals based on the requirements. For example, if you are required to record transaction details of the sales from wholesale and retail separately, it can be done separately. This will record the customer invoices. Purchase Journal \u00b6 You can utilize the Purchase journals record for collecting all purchase-associated transactions. As like in the Sales journals, different purchase journals can also be created to post received vendor bills. Bank Journal \u00b6 The next type, the Bank Journal, records every bank transaction details. You can post your bank statements and can effectively track customer bank payments, vendor bank payments, and every other transaction documented by your related bank account. Cash Journal \u00b6 Now, in the case of a Cash journal, we can record all the cash transactions. In this journal type, you will be able to keep a record of petty cash and daily cash transactions. It can also track details of received customer cash payments. Miscellaneous Journals \u00b6 Now the last journal type, Miscellaneous journals are very useful for keeping records of types of transactions that are not included in the four journals we described earlier( Sales, Purchase, Bank, and Cash). The journal type can consider inventory valuation, inventory adjustments, exchange difference, opening balance, and many others that don't fit into the other four journal types.

One is \u2018Continental Accounting,\u2019 and the other is Anglo-Saxon accounting With the advent of PerfectWORK, PerfectWORK introduced Storno Accounting, which uses negative credit/debit values for reverse entries. Transactions in Continental Accounting \u00b6 The most commonly used accounting, continental accounting, and the PerfectWORK system greatly support continental accounting principles. This accounting will impact the expense account when accomplishing a purchase operation. So the cost of an item is considered as soon as the product is reached in the stock. The PerfectWORK platform applies continental accounting as by default. In addition, the stock can be validated manually or automatically. If it is done manually, the stock is not affected, and the details have to be posted manually at the end of a month or at the end of a year. If the stock valuations need to be recorded as the stock in and out, then opt for the inventory valuation method \u2018Automated.\u2019 The well-established accounting, Continental accounting, has many useful impacts on your business accounting. So we can analyze how the ledgers affect different transactions or operations in continental accounting. Accounting transactions are the monetary activity that directly affects a business\u2019s financial status and financial statements. Basically, we can consider any type of exchange of money under this category. Different organizations or businesses handle these transactions in different ways. So we can have a look at some of the basic accounting transactions. Purchase \u00b6 Purchases are said to be the financial transactions that necessitate the business to acquire the products or services required for creating sales. In the PerfectWORK platform, all the transactions associated with the purchase are called \u2018 Purchase Journals\u201d. All these purchase-related transactions are kept in the purchase voucher. It is the transaction processed by the vendor of a product or service purchased, and it can even be a product, purchase, service, or any other asset purchase. A purchase entails a whole set of transactions such as Purchase order, Material Receipt, Rejection Out, Purchase Invoice, and Purchase Return. Purchase Order: \u00b6 A purchase order can be defined as an official document presented by a buyer consigning to pay the seller for the sale of a particular product or service to be issued in the future. Creating a purchase order for any goods or services from a vendor is possible for a necessary amount. The initiation of purchase orders does not have a direct impact on both the stock or account ledgers. Material Receipt: \u00b6 The next procedure is Material receipt, which refers to information like product quantities and lot numbers in relation to the products that are intended for the on sight work performed by the employees. If the supplier sends the product, the inventory item must be received, and it must be moved to the inventory. And the quantities will be updated in the inventory. So in the case of Material Receipt, only the stock accounts get affected. When receiving the product, the \u2018Stock Valuation Account\u2019 and \u2018Stock Input Account\u2019 get affected in the PerfectWORK platform. Accounts Nature Increasing/Decreasing Debit/Credit Stock valuation account Asset Increasing Debit Stock Input account Expense Decreasing Credit Rejection Out: \u00b6 There are many situations where the organization returns the purchased items even before meeting the payment. It can be for any reason. When the product gets damaged, the product will be rejected. Likewise, there will be a lot of reasons behind the rejection. As a result, the stock will be reversed. In this case, the stock will be affected, and there will be no impact on the accounts. In addition, the stock value will also decrease. Accounts Nature Increasing/Decreasing Debit/Credit Stock valuation account Asset Decreasing Credit Stock Input account Expense Increasing Debit Purchase invoice: \u00b6 If you are creating an invoice for the purchase order, it will affect the payable account and the expense account. The payable account will get credited because the nature of the payable account is \u2018Liability\u2019. On the other hand, the expense account gets debited because the nature of the expense account is \u201cexpense.\u201d Accounts Nature Increasing/Decreasing Debit/Credit Account Payable Liability Increasing Credit Expense Account Expense Increasing Debit When you create a payment, the payable account and the outstanding receipt account are also impacted. If the payment has been given, the liability will decrease. Consequently, the payable account will be debited. From PerfectWORK 4.0 onwards for keeping the unreconciled entries, a temporary account - outstanding payments is used in bank and cash journals. The outstanding payment\u2019s nature is \u201cAsset.\u201d So when the assets decrease, the outstanding payment account is credited. Accounts Nature Increasing/Decreasing Debit/Credit Account Payable Liability Decreasing Debit Outstanding Payments Liability Increasing Credit Once it is reconciled with the bank statement, the amount will be transferred to the bank account. As a result, the outstanding payments account becomes debited, and the bank is credited. Accounts Nature Increasing/Decreasing Debit/Credit Outstanding Payments Liability Decreasing Debit Bank Account Asset Decreasing Credit Purchase Return: \u00b6 Purchase Return means if a purchaser returns their purchased product to the seller in favor of refund, store credit, or any other reason based upon the seller\u2019s obligation. Purchase returns also will occur occasionally. Like if the purchaser is not satisfied with the product, if they incorrectly purchased the product, or when the seller sends them the wrong product or even bought more items than they actually require. In the Purchase return, it happens after the invoice, hence reducing the stock and the paid amount wants to be refunded. So the purchase return will affect both the stock accounts and the accounts. For compensating this, suitable reverse journal entries want to be generated. The journal entries for every purchase transaction are described in the table below. Operation Accounts Affected Debit Credit Purchase order No Accounts Affected Material Receipt Stock Valuation Account Stock Interim Account XX .. .. XX Purchase Bill Expense Account Account Payable XX .. .. XX Registering Payment Account Payable Outstanding Payments XX .. .. XX Reconciling Outstanding Payments XX Operation Accounts Affected Debit Credit Bank Account XX Sales \u00b6 Sales transactions are the disposition of products, services, or any other items, including tangible and intangible, or a sale, contract, or other transfers. Here we can discuss how the PerfectWORK platform helps you to manage sales transactions and their associated operations and how the journal entries are impacted. The sales transaction includes operations such as Sales Orders, Delivery Notes, Rejection IN, Sales Invoices, and Sales Returns. First, we can look at the Sales Order. Sales Order: \u00b6 A Sale Order is merely a document generated by the vendor for determining the information about the product or service requested by the customer. The Sales order includes every detail, such as product-service details along with the price, quantity, terms and conditions, and many more aspects. So the sale order is meant for only creating an order, as it never impacts stock or accounts. Delivery Note: \u00b6 A Delivery Note is an aspect associated with the shipment or the delivery of products. This will consist of the information about the product, quantity, and price of products included in the delivery. The Delivery Note can also be called a \u2018Dispatch Note\u2019 or \u2018Goods Received Note.\u2019 As a confirmed order is delivered to the customer from the Inventory, the stock value decreases. Delivering products to customers affects two accounts, the \u2018Stock Valuation Account\u2019 and \u2018Stock Output account\u2019. Accounts Nature Increasing/Decreasing Debit/Credit Stock valuation account Asset Decreasing Credit Stock Output account Expense Increasing Debit Rejection IN: \u00b6 A Rejection IN is a very useful aspect for keeping records of rejected and returned products by the customer.

This accounting will impact the expense account when accomplishing a purchase operation. So the cost of an item is considered as soon as the product is reached in the stock. The PerfectWORK platform applies continental accounting as by default. In addition, the stock can be validated manually or automatically. If it is done manually, the stock is not affected, and the details have to be posted manually at the end of a month or at the end of a year. If the stock valuations need to be recorded as the stock in and out, then opt for the inventory valuation method \u2018Automated.\u2019 The well-established accounting, Continental accounting, has many useful impacts on your business accounting. So we can analyze how the ledgers affect different transactions or operations in continental accounting. Accounting transactions are the monetary activity that directly affects a business\u2019s financial status and financial statements.

The Anglo-Saxon Accounting have noted many differences as compare to Continental Accounting . In Continental Accounting, we discussed that the expense account is affected by a purchase. But in Anglo-Saxon Accounting, the expense account gets affected after processing a sale order. If you want to get the full feature of Anglo Saxon accounting, you need to activate the feature from the PerfectWORK Accounting Configuration Settings. One more significant feature of the Anglo-Saxon Accounting is the cost distinctions between Account and Stock account properties when the inventory valuation is automated. The price difference account is applied to record the difference in price between the vendor bill and the purchase order. Transactions in Anglo-Saxon Accounting \u00b6 In some scenarios, the expense will not record when it is purchased. The purchases may be bulk purchases and will be consumed for a long period of time. Therefore, adding those as an expense to financial entries will create a greater impact on the profit and loss of the company. As a result, in order to handle those situations, it is a standard practice to record purchased items as assets and expenses at the time of consumption. The expense of consumed assets is recorded in ledgers. We will begin with the purchase of a product. Purchase Order: \u00b6 Creating purchase orders generates only a valid document for receiving goods or services from the vendor, which will not affect any accounting ledgers. Receipt: \u00b6 Once the receipt of goods is acknowledged, the incoming assets have to be recorded in stock. Thus stock accounts get affected, both stock input accounts and stock valuation accounts. Accounts Nature Increasing/Decreasing Debit/Credit Stock valuation account Asset Increasing Debit Stock Input account Asset Decreasing Credit Here the incoming value or stock recorded in the \u2018Stock input account\u2019, this will be considered as assets and if it is not sold out or consumed, thus it becomes a liability.

[ Liability = -Assets, as liability increases or asset decreases ] Return: \u00b6 In some cases, there will be a chance of returning the purchased product due to quality issues or product damage. Thus the stock move is just the opposite of the incoming, and stock accounts are reversed. Accounts Nature Increasing/Decreasing Debit/Credit Stock valuation account Asset Decreasing Credit Stock Input account Asset Increasing Debit Purchase Bill: \u00b6 Once the purchase receipt is done, the next step is to post its purchase bill. Accounts Nature Increasing/Decreasing Debit/Credit Account Payable Liability Increasing Credit Tax Account Asset Increasing Debit Stock Input account Asset Increasing Debit In Anglo-Saxon, as mentioned above, the direct expense will not be recorded at the time of purchase; instead, it will be recorded as an asset. Thus here, \u2018Account Payable\u2019 and \u2018Stock interim accounts\u2019 are affected once a bill is generated. Account Payable records the amount to pay for the vendor. Thus on bill generation the payable amount to the vendor increases, which increases the liability of the company and the Account Payable credited. Register Payment: \u00b6 Registering payment makes payment or sends money to the vendor. During this process, \u2018Account Payable\u2019 and \u2018Outstanding Payment Accounts\u2019 get affected. Accounts Nature Increasing/Decreasing Debit/Credit Account Payable Liability Decreasing Debit Outstanding Payments Liability Increasing Credit As the company makes payment to the vendor, the liability of the company decreases. Account payable records the payable liabilities of the company. Thus Account Payable, whose nature is a liability, and as liability decreases, it gets debited. The Outstanding Payment account is the intermediary account that is used along with cash and bank journals that keeps unreconciled outgoing payments. And these outstanding payment accounts are used to reconcile with the bank statement rather than the Account payable. Thus here on registering payment \u2018Outstanding Payments\u2019 account gets credited as liability increases. Reconciliation: \u00b6 As the next level bank statement has to be matched with vendor payment. So on reconciliation, the \u2018Outstanding Payment\u2019 and \u2018Bank\u2019 accounts are affected.

The sales transaction involves different operations, including order creation, processing delivery of the product to the customer, invoice generation, and its payment and reconciliation. Sales Order: \u00b6 The creation of a sales order makes a valid document for customers, including the products and services they require, quantity and confirmed price, etc. It does not affect any accounts. Delivery Note: \u00b6 As an order is confirmed, the next step is to deliver the items to the customer. Once delivery is validated, stock account properties will be affected. The \u2018Stock Output Account\u2019 records the stock delivered to the customer. The nature of a \u2018Stock Output Account\u2019 is Asset, and here, the asset value increases and is debited. And the total stock value or asset value from the warehouse decreases, which is kept in the \u2018Stock Valuation Account.\u2019 Thus the Stock Valuation Account is credited. Accounts Nature Increasing/Decreasing Debit/Credit Stock valuation account Asset Decreasing Credit Stock Output account Asset Increasing Debit Return Operation: \u00b6 Consider the return of product from the customer due to any reason. Thus the stock is also reversed as follows. Accounts Nature Increasing/Decreasing Debit/Credit Stock valuation account Asset Increasing Debit Stock Output account Asset Decreasing Credit Sales Invoice: \u00b6 While creating a sales invoice for a customer, the Income Account and Account Receivable gets affected. The nature of Income Account is income, and Account Receivable is assets. Thus on creating income increases, thus Income Account is credited, and asset increases, therefore Account Receivable is debited. Along with this, two more ledgers are affected, the \u2018Stock Output Account\u2019 and the \u2018Expense\u2019 Account, since, in Anglo-Saxon Accounting, the expense is affected once the purchased product is consumed or sold out.

Reconciliation is the right method to identify any inconsistencies between them. This method is helpful for substantiating that the accounts in the general ledger are uniform, precise, and complete. In the case of Account Reconciliation, it will be beneficial to describe the difference between two financial records or account balances. That means the system allows you to ensure the money that drops from an account matches the money that is actually spent. This adequate method is very comfortable for ascertaining that the balances after each accounting period are equal. Little kinds of differences may be reasonably caused by the time of payments and deposits. However, the unauthorized discrepancies will be identified successfully. You can reconcile your records as a basis of daily, monthly, or yearly. In the PerfectWORK platform, you can see both Payment Matching and Bank Reconciliation. These two methods are used for matching and reconciling entries. Let us discuss each one below. Payment Matching \u00b6 In the Payment Matching method, the strategy applied is that the invoice created or the bill created will be compared against customer payments or vendor payments. As an example, suppose a customer invoice is created and registered payment from the invoice. The payment matching will be performed automatically. However, when the customer payment is added, the payment should match the invoice. Examples for Reconciliation \u00b6 Reconciliation is the process of linking journal items of a specific account and matching credits and debits. Its primary purpose is to link payments to their related invoices to mark them as paid. This is done by doing a reconciliation on the accounts receivable account and/or the accounts payable account. Reconciliation is performed automatically by the system when: the payment is registered directly on the invoice the links between the payments and the invoices are detected at the bank matching process Customer Statement Example Accounts Receivable Debit Credit Invoice 1 100 Partial payment 1/2 70 Invoice 2 65 Partial payment 2/2 30 Payment 2 65 Invoice 3 50 Total to pay 50 Bank Reconciliation \u00b6 The Bank Reconciliation procedure is very effective for helping the user to match an individual or an organization\u2019s cash account information to bank details. Using the comparing method, the bank reconciliation enables an organization to understand whether there are any dissimilarities in the account. With these advanced advantages, an organization will be able to obtain fast corrective actions if any variances are found. Bank reconciliation is to match the system payment entries with the bank statement. As per the above example, the customer invoice is matched with the customer payment. Now the next is to match with bank statements. There will be an entry in the bank statement corresponding to the invoice. Now reconciling with the bank statement will be termed as bank reconciliation. Bank reconciliation is the matching of bank statement lines (provided by your bank) with transactions recorded internally (payments to suppliers or from customers). For each line in a bank statement, it can be: matched with a previously recorded payment : a payment is registered when a check is received from a customer, then matched when checking the bank statement. recorded as a new payment : the payment's journal entry is created and econciled with the related invoice when processing the bank statement. recorded as another transaction : bank transfer, direct charge, etc. PerfectWORK should automatically reconcile most transactions; only a few should need manual review. When the bank reconciliation process is finished, the balance on the bank account in PerfectWORK should match the bank statement's balance. Checks Handling \u00b6 There are two approaches to managing checks and internal wire transfers: Two journal entries and a reconciliation One journal entry and a bank reconciliation Two journal entries and a reconciliation The first journal entry is created by registering the payment on the invoice. The second one is created when registering the bank statement.

As a result, the sum of credit will always be equal to the sum of debits. In accordance with the timing of recording revenues and expenses, Accounting Methods are classified into two groups. Cash Basis Accrual Basis So Cash Basis and Accrual Basis accounting are the two different methods for recording tax information on accounting transactions. The recording of the transaction (revenue and expense) time is the notable difference between these two methods. Let us have a look at these two methods. Accrual Basis \u00b6 Accrual Basis can be considered the default Accounting method that records tax information on revenue and expenses immediately after the generation of revenue or expense. This method available in PerfectWORK is handy for recording the taxes in the accounting ledgers and tax reports at the moment it occurred. Cash Basis Method \u00b6 In the Cash Basis Method, tax on revenue or expenses is reported after receiving cash from customers or after cash payment to suppliers. In this case, the tax on revenues is recorded only when the payments are acquired. The expenses are reported only when the payment has been made to suppliers or employees. The Cash Basis option can be activated from the Accounting Configuration Settings. The Cash basis accounting will also affect the taxes that can also be created using the same method in association with the invoice or payment.","title":"Accounting Methods"},{"location":"01_application_guide/20_accounting/01_accounting_concept/40_accounting_methods/#accrual-basis","text":"Accrual Basis can be considered the default Accounting method that records tax information on revenue and expenses immediately after the generation of revenue or expense.

The chart of accounts (COA) is the list of all the accounts used to record financial transactions in the general ledger of an organization. The accounts are usually listed in the order of appearance in the financial reports. Most of the time, they are listed as follows : Balance Sheet accounts: Assets Liabilities Equity Profit & Loss: Income Expense When browsing your chart of accounts, you can filter the accounts by number, in the left column, and also group them by Account Type. Fiscal Localization \u00b6 The country you select at the creation of your database (or additional company on your database) determines which fiscal localization package is installed by default. This package includes a standard chart of accounts already configured according to the country\u2019s regulations. You can use it directly or set it according to your company\u2019s needs. Warning It is not possible to modify the fiscal localization of a company once a journal entry has been posted. To create a new account, go to , click on Create, and fill out the form. Code and name \u00b6 Each account is identified by its code and name , which also indicates the account\u2019s purpose. Type \u00b6 Correctly configuring the account type is critical as it serves multiple purposes: Information on the account\u2019s purpose and behavior Generate country-specific legal and financial reports Set the rules to close a fiscal year Generate opening entries To configure an account type, open the Type field\u2019s drop-down selector and select the right type among the following list: Report Category Account Types Balance Sheet Assets Receivables Bank and Cash Current Assets Non Current Assets Prepayments Fixed Assets Liabilities Payable Credit Card Current Liabilities Non Current Liabilities Profit & Loss Income Income Other Income Expense Expense Depreciation Cost of Revenue Other Other Off-Balance Sheet Assets, deferred expenses, and deferred revenues automation \u00b6 Some account types display a new field to automate the creation of assets entries, deferred expenses entries, and deferred revenues entries. You have three choices for the Automation field: No: this is the default value. Nothing happens. Create in draft: whenever a transaction is posted on the account, a draft entry is created, but not validated. You must first fill out the corresponding form. Create and validate: you must also select a model . Whenever a transaction is posted on the account, an entry is created and immediately validated. Default taxes \u00b6 Select a default tax that will be applied when this account is chosen for a product sale or purchase. Tags \u00b6 Some accounting reports require tags to be set on the relevant accounts. By default, you can choose among the tags that are used by the Cash Flow Statement . Account groups \u00b6 Account groups are useful to list multiple accounts as sub-accounts of a bigger account and thus consolidate reports such as the Trial Balance . By default, groups are handled automatically based on the code of the group. For example, a new account 131200 is going to be part of the group 131000 . Create account groups manually \u00b6 Note Regular users should not need to create account groups manually. The following section is only intended for rare and advanced use cases.

Allow reconciliation \u00b6 Some accounts, such as accounts made to record the transactions of a payment method, can be used for the reconciliation of journal entries. For example, an invoice paid with a credit card can be marked as paid if reconciled with its payment. Therefore, the account used to record credit card payments needs to be configured as allowing reconciliation . To do so, check the Allow Reconciliation box in the account\u2019s settings, and save. Deprecated \u00b6 It is not possible to delete an account once a transaction has been recorded on it. You can make them unusable by using the Deprecated feature. To do so, check the Deprecated box in the account\u2019s settings, and save. Purpose \u00b6 This documentation outlines the processes associated with a Chart of Accounts in the Accounting application of PerfectWORK 15. A Chart of Accounts is a listing of all accounts used in the general ledger of an organization. The Chart of Accounts should be tailored to reflect the actual operations of a company and an organization has the freedom to add or remove accounts, as needed, to better suit its needs. Process To get started, navigate to the Accounting app. Configuring the Chart of Accounts \u00b6 Good to Know! \u00b6 Why Is My Chart of Accounts is Empty? \u00b6 If you get to the Chart of Accounts page but see nothing listed, you'll need to go into Configuration > Settings and click Install More Packages. From there, install the default accounts for your country. When you're done, go back to the settings page and, under Fiscal Localization, set the Package to \"Configurable Account Chart Template\". Click Save . You should now see accounts listed in your Chart of Accounts. Down the left-hand side, you have the ability to view numerical ranges using the index marks. For example, clicking 1 will expand indexing to the next character (10, 11, 12, etc.) allowing you to filter directly to the range you need. To simplify this view, click Group By > Account Type . This helps to narrow down to the specific accounts you're looking for. Working with Default Accounts \u00b6 To give an idea of where you'll see these accounts used throughout PerfectWORK, click configuration > Management > Product categories and select a category from the list. At the bottom of this page, you'll see the Account Properties . The accounts listed in these fields are created and configured in the Chart of Accounts, and this category happens to use PerfectWORK's default settings from the configuration. You can see the accounts under Account Properties , for example, are set to use generalized accounts: Product Sales & Expenses . These accounts have very basic settings that allow you to use PerfectWORK relatively quickly without having to go into every product category and select all of your custom accounts. Because PerfectWORK has so many pre-configured accounts, it's best practice to determine the existing default account, then edit the account's number and/or name accordingly. For example, PerfectWORK's default Product Sales account is already mapped to all product categories and expense accounts within PerfectWORK. By deprecating (disabling) this account and creating a new account, you'll then need to update all related categories and accounts affected by the change. To avoid this extra work, you only need to map your existing accounts to PerfectWORK's default accounts. In our example, we'll map the 400000 Product Sales account from PerfectWORK with our own corresponding account, 400002 Retail Sales . To get started, we'll click Configuration > Accounting > Chart of Accounts , then click SETUP to the right of Product Sales . Once there, click EDIT and change the settings to match your business's settings. When done, click Save . Now, when we go look at the same product category we opened above, we'll see the changes we've made. We accomplished this by simply editing a default account, and now there's no need to re-configure each category manually. This is a huge time saver! Deleting an Account \u00b6 Important! \u00b6 Delete vs. Deprecate \u00b6 In a production environment with existing data, you should not delete an account. Instead, Edit the account and, select the Deprecated checkbox, then click Save . Deprecated accounts will still show up in your list view of accounts unless you filter them out, but they can no longer be selected throughout PerfectWORK. If you still wish to delete an account after reading the warning above, simply click the checkbox to the left of the account's code, in list view, then click Action > Delete . You will see this message asking you to confirm your intention to delete. You can click OK to continue. If an account has recorded journal items, you'll see the following message. If an account is set as a default in the system, you'll see the following message. You'll need to deprecate the account instead, which we covered in the Important section, above. Creating a New Account \u00b6 From the list view of accounts, click Create . This opens a new line for you to add basic information: Code: A unique number that helps in the identification of the account type and may also be coded with further information. This is an alphanumeric fields that can also accommodate hyphens, decimals, and spaces. Account Name: The name of the account. Type: The type of account, which is detailed below in the 'Choosing an Account Type' section. Allow Reconciliation: Check this box if this account allows invoices and payments matching of journal items. When enabled, it will display the RECONCILE button. When these fields are complete, click Save . Once saved, click SETUP to the far right of the new entry to open it in form view. From within the account, click EDIT to add any additional information. Type: This required field is used to define the financial reports on which the account will be included, and where the accounts will appear on those reports. Also, the fields listed in this window will change based on the type selected. Default Taxes: If default taxes should apply to this account, select them here. This will auto-populate based on your app configuration. Tags: Optional keywords that assist in custom reporting. Allowed Journals: Define which journal(s) this account can be used for. Leave it empty for all journals. Account Currency: If your system is set for multiple currencies, select what is appropriate for this account here. Allow Reconciliation: Checking the box here sets the account's entries as available to be reconciled (or matched) to other entries. This is used in reconciling bank statements, matching vendor payments to vendor bills, cash receipts to customer invoices, etc. Deprecated : Use this as an alternative to deletion to indicate the account is no longer in use. Group: If your system has been set up to use Account Groups , then this field will indicate into which account group this account falls as set by its account number. Account Groups assist in the organization and filtering your accounts, and will also create subsections on your financial reports. Company: If you have multiple companies set up, set the company to which this account belongs. When finished, click SAVE . Choosing an Account Type \u00b6 Choosing the correct Account Type is extremely important as they affect your overall reporting. \u00b6 Assets Receivable Record funds owed to you (Example: For products or services delivered) Bank and Cash Record bank and cash transfer transactions Current Assets All assets that can be reasonably expected to be converted into cash within one year Non-current Assets Long-term investments where the full value will not be realized within the accounting year Prepayments An asset account that stores partial payments from customers that still owe money Fixed Assets Record assets and property that cannot be easily converted into cash (These will not be used up, consumed, or sold within the current accounting year) Liabilities Payable Record funds you owe (Example: Bills from suppliers) Credit Card A bank account that is considered to be a liability Current Liabilities Financial obligations that are payable within one year Non-current Liabilities Financial obligations that will not become due within the accounting year Equity Equity Record capital gains and losses (To measure the net worth of your business) Current Year Earnings Record net income or loss for your company within the current year (The difference between all revenues and expenses on an income statement) Profit & Loss Income Income Record income that comes from your company's main business (Example: Sales Revenue) Other Income Record income that does not come from your company's main business (Example: Interest) Profit & Loss Expense Expense Record outflow of funds to pay for goods and services your business uses Depreciation An expense that comes from a Fixed Asset account Cost of Revenue Record total cost incurred to obtain a sale and the cost of the goods or services sold, often referred to as 'Direct Costs' (Example: The cost of materials, equipment, or labor used in production) Other Off-Balance Sheet Useful for annual reporting annexes View Journal Items for Each Account \u00b6 Navigate back to CONFIGURATION > Accounting > CHART OF ACCOUNTS and click SETUP next to an entry from the list. From within the Account record, you have the option to view Unreconciled Entries and Journal Items by clicking the Balance smart button. Note that the current balance of this account is displayed on the smart button as well. Once there you can use the Filters to narrow down your view. This helps when you want to see common results, such as Posted, UnPosted, Unreconciled items, etc. Good to Know! \u00b6 Stock Interim Accounts \u00b6 PerfectWORK has two preconfigured accounts that you may not recognize. Stock Interim (Received): This account is to record goods received that are not yet billed. Stock Interim (Delivered): This account is to record goods delivered that are not yet invoiced. Because PerfectWORK uses double-entry accounting, these act as temporary accounts to track stock in either of these scenarios.","title":"Chart of Accounts"},{"location":"01_application_guide/20_accounting/10_bank_cash/10_chart_of_accounts/#configuration","text":"It is very simple to define the chart of accounts in Odoo. you just need to select the Chart of Account menu in the Accounting section available under the Configuration tab of the PerfectWORK Accounting module as shown in the image below.

You can see the accounts under Account Properties , for example, are set to use generalized accounts: Product Sales & Expenses . These accounts have very basic settings that allow you to use PerfectWORK relatively quickly without having to go into every product category and select all of your custom accounts. Because PerfectWORK has so many pre-configured accounts, it's best practice to determine the existing default account, then edit the account's number and/or name accordingly. For example, PerfectWORK's default Product Sales account is already mapped to all product categories and expense accounts within PerfectWORK. By deprecating (disabling) this account and creating a new account, you'll then need to update all related categories and accounts affected by the change. To avoid this extra work, you only need to map your existing accounts to PerfectWORK's default accounts. In our example, we'll map the 400000 Product Sales account from PerfectWORK with our own corresponding account, 400002 Retail Sales .

A journal entry is simply an accounting record of a business transaction that includes the details of the transaction, such as the date, amount, account affected, and a brief description of the transaction. Journal entries are a key part of the double-entry accounting system, which requires that every financial transaction be recorded in at least two accounts. In PerfectWORK Accounting, Journals are the documents that are used to record accounting transactions. Journals are used to record sales, purchases, receipts, payments, and other transactions which affect the financial position of the company. Journals also provide a summary of the company\u2019s financial position at any given point in time. It can be used to reconcile accounts, analyze financial trends, and produce reports. It will provide a record of the date, amount, and purpose of each transaction. Journals can be created for specific periods such as monthly, quarterly, and annually. As we know, Journals are the significant facets of accounting operations in any company that will help you to define the specific operations as categorizing and the financial operations are based on it. Every type of business requires journal entries and maintains them. The PerfectWORK Accounting module possesses a powerful feature that allows for the creation and management of custom journals. Using this option, you can define every journal. For managing it, PerfectWORK furnishes a separate menu called Journals under the Accounting section of the Configuration menu. The screenshot of the Journals window is depicted below. Configuration \u00b6 The Journals window clearly depicts the preview of the previously configured Journals and also offers a CREATE button to create a new Journal. The window depicts the significant details of the Journals, such as Journal Name, Type, Journal Group, Short Code, and Default Account, as seen in the image above. The window can be viewed in both Kanban and List view by choosing the respective menu icon placed on the top right corner of the window. The default and customized Filters and Group By options are also available together with the Search bar. The Favourite tab includes various menus such as Save current search, Import records, Link menu in spreadsheet, Insert view in article, Insert link in article, Insert list in spreadsheet, and Add to my dashboard performing respective operations. All these options are very useful for quickly retrieving the needful journal from the longer list of defined journals. In addition, the dedicated PerfectWORK module is very comfortable in specifying the journal Types based on the default ones that are already defined. Also, you can choose a journal type for a respective journal that is being defined. The journal can be Sales, Purchase, Cash, Bank , and Miscellaneous . The Sales journals in Odoo Accounting are journals used to record all sales transactions in a company. These transactions may include Sales orders, deliveries, invoices, customer payments, and any other related transactions. Sales Journals allow for easy tracking of all sales-related information and can be used to generate various reports such as Sales reports, sales trend analysis, and more. Purchase Journals can be used to record all the purchase transactions that are related to the business. These journals are used to track the cost of the goods and services purchased and to create financial statements. The journal entries are used to record the debit and credit side of the purchase and to post the entries to the general ledger. The Purchase Journals are used to track the cost of the goods and services and any tax associated with the purchase. The purchase journals are used to record the purchase of inventory, the purchase of raw materials, and the purchase of finished goods. As we defined earlier, the Sales Journal is used to define all the Sales operations entries of an organization likewise, the Purchase journal defines all the purchase operations of the company. Similarly, the Cash Journal will define all the cash operations entries with respect to the functioning of the company. Moreover, the same as in the case of Bank Journal, where all the Bank based transactions are being entered. A miscellaneous Journal in PerfectWORK Accounting is a type of journal entry used to record any transactions that do not fit into the standard categories of transactions. It can be used to record such items as discounts, returns and allowances, bank charges, and other miscellaneous items. It is also a way to adjust the account balance of any accounts that require adjustments outside of the normal accounting period. The Miscellaneous Journals in PerfectWORK Accounting include: General Journal Adjustment Journal Inventory Adjustment Journal Currency exchange journal Stock valuation Expense Journal Tax Journal The Miscellaneous journal will allow you to manage all the entries which do not fall into the other journals. Sales Journal \u00b6 Now, to configure a new Journal, go for the CREATE button that can be accessed from the top left corner of the Journals window. First of all, in the creation form, you can mention the Journal Name. Then you can pick the corresponding Journal Type using the dropdown menu. The dropdown menu depicts all the journals, such as Sales, Purchase, Cash, Bank, and Miscellaneous. In addition, the Journal Entries menu will allow you to define the Accounting Information, such as Short Code and Currency. The Short Code field can be filled with the shorter name which you want to display. The journal entries of this journal will also be named using this prefix by default. It is very useful for ensuring that the invoices and the credit note entries starts with the allocated code. For example, if we define short code as INV, then when generate invoices, it will start with the term INV and then follows the sequence number. Also, the currency used to enter statements is mentioned in the Currency field. Additionally, based on the selected Type of journal, the window will display additional fields. If you select Sales as the type, you will get additional fields such as Default Income Account and Dedicated Credit Not Sequence. You can create a new one or can also select the default one from the dropdown menu. The Dedicated Credit Note Sequence option can be activated if you don\u2019t want to share the same sequence for invoices and credit notes made from this journal. Further, under the Advanced Settings tab, you have the CONTROL ACCESS section, where you can specify the Allowed accounts in the corresponding field with the help of the dropdown menu. If you don't want any control, you can keep these fields empty. The Lock Posted Entries with Hash field can be enabled or disabled. The accounting entry or invoice receives a hash as soon as it is posted and cannot be modified anymore if when you activate this field. This is very advantageous to ensure that any invoice created under a specific journal does not undergo any changes. That means it cannot be reset to draft or modified to any form once it is posted. If the Type is Sales, you will also depict the additional fields under different sections, such as PAYMENT COMMUNICATIONS, CREATE INVOICES UPON EMAILS , and FOLLOW CUSTOMER PAYMENTS . PAYMENT COMMUNICATION includes Communication Type and Communication Standard fields. In the Communication Type field, you can set the default communication that will appear on customer invoices, once validated, to help the customer to refer to that particular invoice when making the payment. Here you have three options to choose from, which are Open, Based on Customer, and Based on Invoice. Like wise, you can also describe the Communication Standard field. With this field, you can choose different models for each type of reference the default one is the \u2018Odoo reference.\u2019 Further, you can configure Email Servers in the CREATE INVOICES UPON EMAILS section. It will be effective for making sure that if the email is being received under the respective server domain, an invoice will be created. Also, the ELECTRONIC DATA INTERCHANGE section allows you to send XML /EDI invoices through Electronic invoicing. For that, you can activate the E-Invoice(IN) option. Electronic Invoicing will be available if the respective module for \u2018e-invoicing\u2019 is installed, which will be available with accounting localization. On enabling this feature an XML/EDI document will be generated and attached along with invoices and credit notes. Also, you have the field to Schedule Activity for the following customer payments. When you define any activity, it will be automatically scheduled on the payment due date, improving the collection process. You can choose the activity with the help of the drop-down menu. Finally, you have the option for sending messages as well as for describing log notes to the followers of the corresponding journal. These followers may be the other users of your PerfectWORK platform who may be employees of your company or associated members. The Send Message option is very useful for notifying any relevant information, and the Log Note option assists you in marking the changes done by the employees and details it together with the time and date. In addition to all these options, you can view the smart tab on the top right corner of the window, as picturized in the image below. The smart tab \u2018Journal entries\u2019 will show all the journal entries recorded in that particular journal. Now we are clear on the configuration of the Sales journal type. The Journal creation steps of the Sales, Purchase and Miscellaneous are the same in the PerfectWORK. Bank Journal \u00b6 Let us discuss the configuration steps of the Bank journal, which show differences from the Sales, Purchase, and Miscellaneous journal types. When you select the Journal Type as Bank, the creation window will depict the different tabs such as Journal Entries, Incoming Payments, Outgoing Payments, and Advanced Settings. Under the Journal Entries tab, you are required to describe the detail regarding Journal Entries. So you can define the ACCOUNTING INFORMATION such as the Bank Account, Suspense Account, Profit Account, Loss Account, Short Code and Currency details. The Suspense Account is used to post bank statement transactions until the bank account is reconciled to the payments, so the suspense account will function as the temporary account till the reconciliation of the bank statement transactions for the respective journal operation. Likewise the Profit Account is used to register a profit when the ending balance of a cash register differs from what the system computes. Similarly, the Loss Account are beneficial to register a loss when the ending balance of the cash register differs from what the system computes. The section also displays the Dedicated Payment Sequence option for activating. Furthermore, in the BANK ACCOUNT NUMBER section, the Account Number can be defined in the corresponding field. Also, you have the option to define Bank Feeds, and based on your selection, the bank statement registration will be done. Here you have three options such as Undefined Yet, Import(CAMT, CODA, CSV, OFX, QIF), and Automated Bank Synchronization. When you are choosing the Import option, you will depict further fields such as QIF Decimal Separator - which is applicable to avoid conversion issues and QIF Dates format - here, you can choose either dd/mm/yy or mm/dd/yy based on the company. The third field is Split Transactions which can be activated for split collective payments for CODA files. The Import option allows you to import details from the dashboard. Automated Bank Synchronization can be chosen for making the PerfectWORK platform accessible for fetching the invoice payment information straightly from the bank servers. Also, from the Dashboard, you will prevail the review of the synchronized operations. Now in the Incoming Payments tab, the incoming payment configuration details can be defined. So you can define the Payment Method and Name using the Add a line option. Under the Outgoing Payments tab, you have to configure the outgoing payment methods. It is almost the same with the Incoming Payments, so you can define the \u2018Payment Method\u2019 and \u2018Name\u2019 using the Add a line option. You can view the dropdown menu and can choose the method and can apply. If the payment method is a new one, you can configure it without much effort. Moreover, the Manual Numbering field displayed in the CHECK PRINTING section can be activated if your preprinted checks are not numbered. Also you have the NACHA CONFIGURATION and where you have a lot of fields such as Immediate Destination, Destination, Immediate Origin, Company Identification, Origination Dfi Identification, and all these details will be provided by the bank. Also, Manual Numbering under the CHECK PRINTING field can be checked if your pre printed checks are not numbered. If we consider the Outstanding Account operations, it will be like, whenever a customer generates the payment for the invoice, it doesn\u2019t credit the bank account directly, instead, it will be fall into the Outstanding Receipt Account, which can be defined here. After reconciling the Bank statement and the payment automatically or manually, only the payment will be credited to the bank account of the company. Likewise, when we consider the case of Purchase payment, the amount for the vendor bill will be generated from the Accounts payable, and will be moved to the Outstanding Payments Account and then, when the bank statement reconciliation takes place in relation with the vendor bill bank will be reconciled with outstanding payment entries instead of the payable account. The last tab available in the Journals configuration, Advanced Settings , is same as the Sales, Purchase, and Miscellaneous accounts. So the account operation details for the Cash and the Bank journals can be configured based upon the operational requirements. These are the right way you can define and edit the Journals and these journals can be used for defining journal entries for an organization\u2019s finance management. Journal Groups \u00b6 Categorization is an important factor in business operations where you will get a chance to categorize various elements of business operations. Which will help you to segregate the whole operation into delicate discs. The PerfectWORK platform allows you to define multiple journals for the smooth functioning of the accounting operations of a company. While defining journal entries in different journals, there is a great chance for mixing up the entries. So the PerfectWORK platform developed a unique feature to group the journals. This advanced feature will be excessive support for the classification of all the configured journals. To get access to the Journal Groups menu, go for the Configuration menu of the Accounting module, where you can view all the journal groups previously described in the Journal Groups window as shown below. When you click on the Journal Groups menu, you will enter into the window. The CREATE button allows you to create new Journal Groups. The moment you go over the CREATE button, a new line will be displayed in the same window for configuring journal groups. There you can provide the Journal Groups Name, and can give out the Excluded Journals. The Company field will be auto-allocated and can be altered. The different sorting functionalities available in the Odoo is also available in this window. The default and customizable filters and Group By options help you to quickly sort out the required groups. In the PerfectWORK Accounting module, Journal Grouping is one of the outstanding features that allows you to organize your accounting journals into groups. The groups can be used to better manage accounting information and simplify reporting. This feature makes it easier for users to track and view your transactions in one place. Journal grouping also helps to ensure accuracy in the financial records by providing a centralized way to compare the different types of transactions. These categories can then be used to organize and analyze financial data in a more efficient manner. This feature can be used to group journals by company, type of transaction, or other criteria. This allows users to quickly search for and access specific journals when needed. Journal grouping also helps users keep their accounts organized, as journals can be grouped according to the type of transaction. It also helps with accounting reconciliation, as users can easily identify which journals need to be reconciled. These Journal groups are used in reporting to display relevant data together. You can fulfill the Filtering and Group By aspects of different journal\u2019s operations and accounting operations. The PerfectWORK platform gives extreme prominence for report generation, and various kinds of accounts-related reports can be obtained within seconds with the help of filtering tools. You only need to set Journal Types as the filtering aspect to make the process easier. It is also possible to select the Chart of Account Types for the respective one while defining it because it has the convenience of sorting out the needs of the accounting information as regards to the Chart of Account Types which are being defined. The Chart of Account Types can be also be selected for the respective one while defining it, this will be beneficial for the filtration aspects of the accounting information with respect to the Chart of Account Types which are being defined. As the journal group \u2018Bank & Cash Payments\u2019 is chosen in the report, it will exclude the accounts mentioned in the journal from the filter of reports. So the Journal Group feature has a significant impact on the accounting department of any organization for the smooth running of journal management operations. Purpose This documentation outlines the configuration and use of journals in the Odoo 15 Accounting application. We will review the different journal types and their different configuration options. A Journal is where you record all transactions of the same type, in chronological order.

The Purchase Journals are used to track the cost of the goods and services and any tax associated with the purchase. The purchase journals are used to record the purchase of inventory, the purchase of raw materials, and the purchase of finished goods. As we defined earlier, the Sales Journal is used to define all the Sales operations entries of an organization likewise, the Purchase journal defines all the purchase operations of the company. Similarly, the Cash Journal will define all the cash operations entries with respect to the functioning of the company. Moreover, the same as in the case of Bank Journal, where all the Bank based transactions are being entered.

If you don't want any control, you can keep these fields empty. The Lock Posted Entries with Hash field can be enabled or disabled. The accounting entry or invoice receives a hash as soon as it is posted and cannot be modified anymore if when you activate this field. This is very advantageous to ensure that any invoice created under a specific journal does not undergo any changes. That means it cannot be reset to draft or modified to any form once it is posted. If the Type is Sales, you will also depict the additional fields under different sections, such as PAYMENT COMMUNICATIONS, CREATE INVOICES UPON EMAILS , and FOLLOW CUSTOMER PAYMENTS . PAYMENT COMMUNICATION includes Communication Type and Communication Standard fields.

In addition to all these options, you can view the smart tab on the top right corner of the window, as picturized in the image below.

When you select the Journal Type as Bank, the creation window will depict the different tabs such as Journal Entries, Incoming Payments, Outgoing Payments, and Advanced Settings. Under the Journal Entries tab, you are required to describe the detail regarding Journal Entries. So you can define the ACCOUNTING INFORMATION such as the Bank Account, Suspense Account, Profit Account, Loss Account, Short Code and Currency details. The Suspense Account is used to post bank statement transactions until the bank account is reconciled to the payments, so the suspense account will function as the temporary account till the reconciliation of the bank statement transactions for the respective journal operation. Likewise the Profit Account is used to register a profit when the ending balance of a cash register differs from what the system computes. Similarly, the Loss Account are beneficial to register a loss when the ending balance of the cash register differs from what the system computes. The section also displays the Dedicated Payment Sequence option for activating. Furthermore, in the BANK ACCOUNT NUMBER section, the Account Number can be defined in the corresponding field. Also, you have the option to define Bank Feeds, and based on your selection, the bank statement registration will be done. Here you have three options such as Undefined Yet, Import(CAMT, CODA, CSV, OFX, QIF), and Automated Bank Synchronization. When you are choosing the Import option, you will depict further fields such as QIF Decimal Separator - which is applicable to avoid conversion issues and QIF Dates format - here, you can choose either dd/mm/yy or mm/dd/yy based on the company. The third field is Split Transactions which can be activated for split collective payments for CODA files. The Import option allows you to import details from the dashboard. Automated Bank Synchronization can be chosen for making the PerfectWORK platform accessible for fetching the invoice payment information straightly from the bank servers. Also, from the Dashboard, you will prevail the review of the synchronized operations. Now in the Incoming Payments tab, the incoming payment configuration details can be defined. So you can define the Payment Method and Name using the Add a line option. Under the Outgoing Payments tab, you have to configure the outgoing payment methods. It is almost the same with the Incoming Payments, so you can define the \u2018Payment Method\u2019 and \u2018Name\u2019 using the Add a line option. You can view the dropdown menu and can choose the method and can apply. If the payment method is a new one, you can configure it without much effort. Moreover, the Manual Numbering field displayed in the CHECK PRINTING section can be activated if your preprinted checks are not numbered. Also you have the NACHA CONFIGURATION and where you have a lot of fields such as Immediate Destination, Destination, Immediate Origin, Company Identification, Origination Dfi Identification, and all these details will be provided by the bank. Also, Manual Numbering under the CHECK PRINTING field can be checked if your pre printed checks are not numbered. If we consider the Outstanding Account operations, it will be like, whenever a customer generates the payment for the invoice, it doesn\u2019t credit the bank account directly, instead, it will be fall into the Outstanding Receipt Account, which can be defined here. After reconciling the Bank statement and the payment automatically or manually, only the payment will be credited to the bank account of the company. Likewise, when we consider the case of Purchase payment, the amount for the vendor bill will be generated from the Accounts payable, and will be moved to the Outstanding Payments Account and then, when the bank statement reconciliation takes place in relation with the vendor bill bank will be reconciled with outstanding payment entries instead of the payable account. The last tab available in the Journals configuration, Advanced Settings , is same as the Sales, Purchase, and Miscellaneous accounts.

The taxes defined here will be applicable to both the sales and purchase operations if a specified tax is not set on the product or else the taxes defined here will be taken into account for the operations. Let's now look into the options in the Taxes configuration aspects in the Accounting module settings menu. Navigate to Menu Navigate to Accounting Application \u2192 Configuration \u2192 Settings Default Taxes \u00b6 Initially, in the Taxes section, you will be able to configure the Default Taxes for the operation of the business on the platform. These taxes are applied to all the local transactions that are being defined in the platform. Here the Sales Tax and the Purchase Tax can be selected from the drop-down menu available. The taxes can be defined in the Taxes accessible from the Configuration menu of the Accounting module, here you just allocate the respective taxes to be operational based on your need. Tax Return Periodicity \u00b6 The tax that is collected should be returned to the authorities during the specific intervals, it can be based on the operational principle of the industries as well as the authorities. The return filing interval will be based on the authorities and it can be every month, quarterly, or half-yearly, or every year. You can configure the return aspects under the Tax Return Periodicity menu which will imply how often the tax returns have to be made. Under the menu, you can configure the Periodicity which can be set as Annually, Semi-annually, Every 4 months, Quarterly, Every 2 months, or Monthly. Furthermore, you can also configure a Reminder which can be set for the days after the period. Moreover, the Journal in which the taxes collected will be stored can be defined in the menu, these will be the Journals that have been already defined in the platform for the operations. You can also configure the tax accounts by selecting the Configure Your Tax accounts option available which will direct you to the Tax Groups window where the account details of the Taxes can be defined. Here, the taxes defined will be depicted and you can choose each of them to configure the Tax account. You can allocate the Tax current account(payable), Tax current account (receivable), and the Advance Tax payment account, in the Tax Groups menu just as depicted in the following image. Purpose \u00b6 This document outlines the configuration and processes associated with taxes in the Accounting application of PerfectWORK 15. Getting Started \u00b6 PerfectWORK has localization modules for certain countries that will pre-load your default taxes into the database. It's important to add these pre-configured Charts of Accounts before creating your own. To check and see if your country has a module, go to the Apps application. Once there, search for your country name to see if there's an available localization module. If there is, it will include a basic chart of accounts and a local tax list. Process \u00b6 To get started, navigate to the Accounting app. Configuring Taxes \u00b6 To review your taxes, navigate to Configuration > accounting > Taxes . Once there, you'll see a list view of all active configured taxes for Sales or Purchase. Important! \u00b6 How to Handle Default Taxes \u00b6 Many are tempted to remove the default sales tax or otherwise modify it to meet a specific use case. We recommend a more flexible approach, which involves using Fiscal Positions to apply the appropriate tax (or no tax, if taxes would not apply to the order). To use this approach, you'll make some simple changes to the default sales tax. Click into the records with the Tax Type \"Sales\" and: Change the Tax Name to 'Product Sales Tax' Change the Amount to 0.0000% Change the Label on Invoices to 'Sales Tax' Change the Tax Group to 'Taxes' if it was previously set to something more specific. When done, click Save . Repeat this process for the tax with the \"Purchase\" Tax Scope. The Product Sales Tax will act as a generic tax that will be applied to all sale orders without impacting the amount of tax that gets applied with it. The Product Purchase Tax will be added, respectively, to purchase orders. You will then create specific taxes, for each state for example, and map the taxes using Fiscal Positions. For detailed instructions on how this process works, read our Fiscal Positions document. Click on a tax to view its configuration. We will review the Product Sales Tax as an example. Once there, click Edit to see all of the available options. Tax Name : The name of the tax. Tax Computation Group of Taxes: The tax is a set of sub-taxes. Fixed: The tax amount stays the same whatever the price. Percentage of the Price: The tax amount is a% of the price: Percentage of Price Tax Included: The tax amount is a division of the price. Active: This option toggles between 'Active' and 'Archived'. When a tax is not in use, it should be archived rather than deleted.. Tax Type: Select if this type will be for Sales, Purchases, or None. Tax Scope: This is used to restrict the use of this tax to goods or services. Leave it empty to allow it for both. Amount: The amount of tax computation. (Example: If you want a 15% tax, you would select 'Percentage of Price' as the Tax Computation and enter 15 for the Amount). Our example shows a 0.00% tax because we'll be mapping taxes with Fiscal Positions. Under the Definition tab, you'll see the following fields. Distribution for Invoices: This table allows you to outline how the tax on each invoice is distributed across accounts. You can click into an existing line to make changes, or click ADD A LINE to add a new entry. %: Enter the amount of the tax collected that should be distributed to the account indicated on the same line. Based On: Each entry requires a Based On entry. It defaults to the first line, but you can adjust it based on your tax requirements. Account: The account that will be used on taxes for invoices. Leave this field empty to use the product's income account. Tax Grids: Select a tax grid, if applicable. A tax grid is used to automatically generate Tax Reports if they're required in your country. Distribution for Credit Notes: This table allows you to outline how the tax on each credit note is distributed among accounts. You can click into an existing line to make changes, or click ADD A LINE to add a new entry. All entries must add up to 100%. %: Enter the amount of the tax collected that should be distributed to the account indicated on the same line. Based On: Each entry requires a Based On entry. It defaults to the first line, but you can adjust it based on your tax requirements. Account: The account that will be used on taxes for credit notes. Leave this field empty to use the product's income account. Tax Grids: Select a tax grid, if applicable. A tax grid is used to automatically generate Tax Reports if they're required in the distribution of your country. Applicable Code : Determine if the tax will be applied by setting the variable \"result\" to True or False. Good to Know! \u00b6 The totals under Distribution for Invoices and Distribution for Credit Notes must balance each other out, and the tax accounts should be the same unless you have very rare circumstances. Additionally, the order of entries and the number of lines must also match. Label on Invoices : This label will appear on invoices with this tax selected. Tax Group : This allows you to group taxes on invoices and sale orders. In general, we recommend a simple 'Taxes' group that can be applied to most or all taxes. Include in Analytic Cost: If set, the amount computed by this tax will be assigned to the same analytic account as the invoice line (if any). Included in Price : Select this if you want to include this tax in the price. Affect Base of Subsequent Taxes : If set, subsequent taxes will be based on the tax-included price. Base affected by previous taxes : If set, taxes with a lower sequence might affect this one, provided they try to do it. When you're done, click Save . Good to Know! \u00b6 Disable Automatic Taxes \u00b6 If you want to clear all taxes from appearing automatically on Invoices or Vendor Bills, navigate to Configuration > Settings . Under the Taxes section, you will see default taxes for both sales and purchases. If you remove both of those entries, no tax amount will be applied to product sales or purchases automatically. When you're done, click save . Good to Know! \u00b6 Understanding Tax Groups \u00b6 Tax Groups can greatly improve the readability of taxes on invoice and sale order PDFs! Take, for example, a customer purchasing a croissant and a dozen cookies. There are two associated taxes: Sales Tax 6.3% Food Waste Tax 3% The first (Sales Tax) is in the 'Taxes' tax group and the latter (Food Waste) is in its own tax group dedicated to displaying Food Waste taxes as a separate tax item to customers on the invoice. When taxes are in a tax group, the total for the tax group and its name will be totaled and listed below the subtotal on the invoice's PDF. If you only have general sales and purchasing taxes, we recommend using the generic 'Taxes' group, to keep things simple. Setting Default Taxes on a Product \u00b6 To access your products from the Accounting application, navigate to either Customers > Products or Vendors > Products . Note that these menus lead you to the same view. Select the product that you would like to set a default tax on. Click Edit on the product details page. Default Customer Taxes \u00b6 Under the General Information tab, you will see Customer Taxes. This is where you can select the taxes that apply to this product when it is sold to your customers. Select all of the taxes that apply. Default Vendor Taxes \u00b6 Under the Purchase tab, click on the Vendor Taxes drop down and select the default tax for this product. This is the tax that will be applied when this product is purchased from the vendor. When ready, click Save . Important! \u00b6 Remember Fiscal Positions \u00b6 We recommend assigning the default Sales Tax we setup earlier as the Customer Tax across all products. You'll then use Fiscal Positions to map each customer to the correct tax at the time of sale. For instructions on using fiscal positions, read our Fiscal Positions document. Setting Default Taxes on an Account \u00b6 When default taxes are set on an account, this default tax will be applied each time the account is selected. With this setting, regardless of whether or not a product is selected, the default tax will always be present in the taxes column on a sale order or invoice. From within the Accounting app, go to configuration > Accounting > Chart of Accounts . If you don't see the Default Taxes column, use the menu on the top-right of the table to enable it. From within the Default Taxes field, click the drop-down menu and select the default tax you'd like to apply to this account. Note that you can apply both tax scopes: sales and purchases. When ready, click save or simply click out of the field. Taxes in Action \u00b6 To see how taxes are used, let's create an invoice. Navigate to customers > invoices , then click the Create button. Select a Customer from the drop-down menu and then, under the Invoice Lines tab, click Add a line and select a product. Give the product a unit price and in the Taxes column, click the drop-down and select applicable taxes. Once a tax has been selected, the individual tax groups will be listed under the subtotal on the bottom right. Under the joURNAL ITEMS tab, you can see the breakdown of taxes. You will see we have specific lines for the taxes. The account column reflects the accounts defined for the respective tax. When you're done, click Save to keep the invoice as a draft, then click confirm to validate it. Tax Reporting \u00b6 To view your Tax Report, navigate to Reporting > Audit Reports > Tax Report . Here you will see your Sale and Purchase taxes, with columns on the right for the NET amount and the TAX amount. You'll also have several button options at the top of the page. PDF will download a printer-friendly PDF. XLSX will download the data in spreadsheet form. Closing Entry initiates your closing journal entry for the accounting period. Save will save either the XLSX file or PDF file to the associated folder in the Documents application. To Audit or Annotate a tax, click the tax to bring up a drop-down menu.","title":"Taxes"},{"location":"01_application_guide/20_accounting/10_bank_cash/25_taxes/#configuration","text":"Configure your operational taxes for the functional aspects of your company under the Taxes tab of the Settings module.

Process \u00b6 To get started, navigate to the Expenses app. Configuring Expenses \u00b6 Within the Expenses application, click on CONFIGURATION > SETTINGS . Here you'll see the following options: Incoming Emails: If selected and you have configured your PerfectWORK system for Custom Email Servers in your General Settings, you will enter an email alias where expenses can be emailed to in order to generate expenses. Reimburse in Payslip: Select this option to reimburse via payslip rather than separate payments. Expense Digitalization (OCR): This is a paid PerfectWORK feature that will digitalize scanned/uploaded receipts for a more automated method of expense entry into the Expenses app. We will not be covering this functionality in our documentation, but if you need help, please contact us .

Click CONFIGURATION > EXPENSE PRODUCTS to see a kanban view of Expense Products, if any exist. To create a new Expense Product, click CREATE . Complete the following form according to these guidelines: Product Name: The name of the expense. Here are some common expense products to serve as examples: Travel Expenses [Internal]: Used for airfare, car rental, hotels and other similar expenses that are associated with travel that is not being invoiced back to a customer. Travel Expenses [Client]: Used for airfare, car rental, hotels and other similar expenses that are associated with client travel and will be invoiced back to a customer. Meals and Entertainment [Internal]: Used for meals and food purchases that will not be invoiced back to a customer. Meals and Entertainment [Client]: Used for meals and food purchases that will be invoiced back to a customer. Other Products: Various products for other expenses, such as office supplies, cell phones, postage, subscriptions, etc. General Information Cost: This can be configured with a default cost for things like regular monthly expenses (e.g. Cell Phone), but you may wish to leave this at $0 and set the price appropriately on each expense. Unit of Measure: Enter the unit of measure for this product (e.g. each, per unit). Internal Reference: When emailing expenses, this code will serve as a subject prefix when submitting expenses via email.Be creation to keep these unique. Company: If you're in a multi-company environment, leave this blank to apply to all companies. Otherwise, select the individual company to which this applies. Accounting Expense Account : This should be an expense account that makes sense for the type of product. For example, Travel Expenses are assigned a Travel Expenses expense account. Here are some example expense product and account matchups: Vendor Taxes: Taxes that are automatically applied when this expense is purchased. Customer Taxes: Taxes that are automatically applied when this expense is sold/charged to a client. Invoicing Invoicing Policy: Select when this expense should be invoiced back to the customer, when applicable. Re-Invoice Expenses: This should be set to 'No' for all expenses that will not be invoiced back to a client. If it will be invoiced back to a client, this should be set to 'At cost' or 'Sales price'. When you're ready, click SAVE . Important! \u00b6 Configuring Products for Expenses that Will be Invoiced Back to Clients \u00b6 If you are creating an expense product for an expense that will be invoiced back to the client at cost, create your those products here, but you will need to edit them in either the Sales or Inventory applications to configure the Income Account and the Expense Account (under the Accounting tab) to use the same expense account, allowing the account to wash out since the cost and the revenue will match. Entering Expenses \u00b6 Employees can enter their own expenses, and those with proper permissions can enter expenses on behalf of employees. To submit an expense, click MY EXPENSES > MY EXPENSES to report or MY EXPENSES > ALL MY EXPENSES . Once there, click Create and enter details in the following form. Description: Describe the expense including enough details to make it easily identifiable ('Hotel for Trip to X Client', for example). Category: Choose the appropriate expense product. Amount Paid: Set the price based on the receipt total. Amount Due: This will be calculated by the system once SAVED . Taxes: Typically none, but if you have taxes configured, you may choose one or more as needed. Bill Reference: This is a free text field commonly used for something like a receipt or order number. Expense Date: The date the purchase was made. Account: An appropriate expense account, as described above (usually filled by the product). Employee: Select the employee responsible for the expense (usually yourself). Customer to Reinvoice: If the customer is to be invoiced for this expense, select the related Customer's Sales Order from the drop-down list. Analytic Account: If needed (e.g. to bill to a project like potentially large trips or marketing initiatives, or potentially an Analytic Account that is related to the Sale Order chosen earlier.) **Company: S**elect the company reimbursing this expense. Paid By: Indicate who paid this initial expense. Employee (to reimburse): Select this option if an employee made the purchase and needs to be reimbursed. Company: Select this option if the company paid for the purchase and no reimbursement is needed. When you've completed the form, click Save . Next, click Attach receipt and upload the receipt for this purchase. Once you've uploaded your document(s), you'll also see the Receipts smart button with an updated total of attachments added. The attachment(s) can also be found in the chatter. Expense Reports \u00b6 The next step is submitting your Expenses is to create an Expense Report. You may do so in a couple of different ways. You can generate an Expense Report directly from within the Expense record by clicking. CREATE REPORT . This will take you to a draft Expense Report Summary where most of the data you've entered will be populated. It will include information for that particular expense and employee. Review the information on the page, and if you are finished, click SAVE . If you have additional lines to add, look in the Expense tab at the row below your expense and click Add a line . This will open a modal window that will list any unsubmitted expenses for the same employee. You can use the create button at the bottom to go to the typical Expense entry screen and add an expense on-the-fly. Once saved, that new expense will be added to the list. To include that, or any listed expense in the Expense Report currently being created, place a check in the box to the left of those. When ready, click select . You will be returned to the Expense Report screen to review the information on this page. When you're ready, click SAVE (if it shows as an option). You can then click SUBMIT TO MANAGER if your expense requires approval. If you are a manager, you can click APPROVE . Another method for creating a report for one or more expenses is from EXPENSE REPORTS > Reports to Approve and clicking Create . It will take you to the same screen we covered above, but you will need to give the expense report a name, and click Add a line to include any expenses in the list. The final method for creating a report for one or more expenses is by going to My Expenses > All my expenses . Simply select all expenses to submit, then click Create Report . This brings you to the draft Expense Summary Report we covered, above. Using this method, PerfectWORK will automatically name your expense report with the date range of included expenses, and as is typical, you may edit that. Once saved, the expense report will be ready to be submitted for approval, even if no manager is listed. Click Submit to Manager to move the report to a SUBMITTED status as it awaits approval. Good to Know! \u00b6 Sometimes when you transition from an expense to the expense summary, the document count won't update. You can click Save on the summary and reload the page to make sure the count is correct. Approving Expenses \u00b6 As an administrator, you can review pending expenses by clicking Expense Reports > reports to Approve . Here you will see expense reports that have been submitted and await approval. Click into the individual report. If the expense has been created correctly and the appropriate documentation has been attached, click APPROVE . This will move it to the APPROVED stage where you'll Post the expenses. If the expense wasn't submitted correctly, for example if the expense is missing a receipt, click Refuse . Enter a reason for refusal, then click Refuse again. Posting Expenses \u00b6 If you're not coming directly from within an approved expense report, you can view the reports ready to post by clicking Expense Reports > Reports to Post and selecting an expense report to post from the list. This page is your final review. If everything still looks correct, click POST JOURNAL ENTRIES moving the status to POSTED . Once entries are posted, one of two things will happen. If Paid By was set to Company , there will be no further action until the charge hits a card or bank, at which point it will be reconciled. This expense will be marked with a green banner saying IN PAYMENT (or PAID if the payment is reconciled to a bank statement.) If Paid By was Employee (to Reimburse) , the status will change to Posted and you'll have the option to Register Payment directly from the expense. The unpaid expense will also be listed under Expense Reports > reports tO PAY where you'll be able to register payment which will move the status to DONE . The Register Payment modal window allows the selection of the payment details, and pre-fills the Memo field with the employee's name and descriptions of all the related expenses. Review and edit as needed, then click Create Payment to complete the process. The result is an expense report with a green banner saying IN PAYMENT (or PAID if the payment is reconciled to a bank statement.) Re-Invoicing to Clients \u00b6 In this example, we'll click Approve on an expense configured to \"Customer to Reinvoice\". You'll see the related, open Sales Order in the Expense lines. Navigate to the Sales application to find the Sale Order. You can see the entry was created and there's a smart button that links back to the related Expenses . Good to Know! Enter an expense via email: An employee set up in the system can create an email addressed to the email alias you set up in configuration steps at the beginning of this document (e.g. expense@mycompany.com ), with a subject line that exactly matches the \"Reference\" of the expense product (e.g. TRAV-CLIENT) with an attached image of a receipt.

It allows you to assign different tax rules to customers based on their country, state, and other criteria. This helps you manage the different tax regulations in different countries. This is useful for companies that sell products or services to customers in multiple countries. This is very advantageous for handling the taxation requirements of different countries and allows for easy compliance. This feature enables you to configure tax rules in different ways according to the customers' location or product type. It can be used to define different tax rates for different customers or products. This account management entity is the perfect solution for the financial management of a company worldwide. This tool has the power to automatically adapt the taxes and the financial accounts described for the transactions. Configuration \u00b6 The PerfectWORK Accounting software provides a space for the menu Fiscal Positions, which can be accessed under the Accounting section of the Configuration tab. The Fiscal Positions menu performs as the key to the Fiscal Positions window, where you can manage all the fiscal position entries. The window will showcase every predefined Fiscal position, as illustrated in the image below. The window can be accessed in both Kanban and List view. The Kanban view of the window is given below. All the fields that the window displays will be selectable, and it is also possible to select the already defined fiscal position records to view the complete details of the respective one. In addition, the Filters, Group by, and Search options allow you to retrieve the required Fiscal Position if the platform manages more Fiscal Positions. The Favourites tab includes the options such as Save current search, import records, Link menu in spreadsheet, Insert view in article, Insert link in article, Insert list in spreadsheet, and Add to my dashboard options. The CREATE button is a fine way to define required Fiscal Positions. The creation form of the Fiscal Positions is given below. Here you can define the fiscal position name in the Fiscal Position field. Then you can view various fields to configure, such as Use TaxCloud API , Use AvaTax API , Detect Automatically, and Foreign Tax ID . All these fields can be enabled or disabled based on the preferences. TaxCloud \u00b6 If you activate the Use TaxCloud API option, you should enter your taxcloud credentials to compute tax rates automatically. Likewise, the Detect Automatically field makes you able to apply this fiscal position automatically with respect to the country, country group, localities, or the federal state of the partner operation. Furthermore, you have the option to specify the Country where you can mention the country if you want to apply only to a particular country. Now under the Tax Mapping tab of the configuration window, you can define the \u2018Tax on Product\u2019 together with the \u2018Tax to Apply.\u2019 So the corresponding tax which is required to apply to the product can be specified. Additionally, if the fiscal mapping is confirmed by the PerfectWORK system when the partner is allocated for the operation, the matching product tax will be employed in accordance with the fiscal position. Similarly, the Accounting Mapping tab allows you to mention the Account on Product and the Account to use Instead of using the Add a line option. Further, you can type the legal note in the provided Legal Note line, which is the legal mentions that have to be printed on the invoices. AvaTax \u00b6 Similarly, under the Avatax configuration tab of the Fiscal Positions creation form, you can define the Avatax Invoice Account and the Avatax Refund Account, which are the account that will be used by Avatax for invoices and refunds, respectively. Here also, you can add Legal Notes in the provided space. After configuring all these aspects, you can apply to the invoices and bills so that the tax and the accounts will be mapped according to the rule defined as shown in the example. Fiscal position is automatically detected for partners according to the country group, country, federal states provided. Purpose \u00b6 The purpose of this documentation is to outline the use case and processes associated with Fiscal Positions in the Accounting application of PerfectWORK 15 . Fiscal Positions allow you to define the taxes that should be applied for a specific customer or vendor. This is especially useful if you handle customers or vendors in multiple states or counties that have different taxes! It's as easy as just applying the fiscal position to them. Once that happens, the right taxes will be selected for the products they buy automatically! Process \u00b6 To get started, navigate to the Accounting app. Configuring Fiscal Positions \u00b6 Click Configuration > accounting > Fiscal Positions to see a list of configured Fiscal Positions. To make a new record, click Create and complete the following fields. Fiscal Position: Enter a name to describe which customers it will be applied to. Use Taxcloud API: TaxCloud is an API that will detect the customer's tax rate by location, then create and apply the tax rate automatically. To use this method, you'll also need to select the Detect Automatically option when selling to American customers, as well as configure the TaxCloud API with PerfectWORK. Contact Hibou for help configuring this integration. Company: This will auto-populate with the company you're working in. Detect Automatically : This standalone option also allows PerfectWORK to automatically assign this position based on the location criteria you select. When enabled, the following fields will display and should be completed if TaxCloud is not enabled. You can refine this as much as necessary according to your specific requirements. VAT Required: The tax ID of your company in the region mapped by the fiscal position. Country Group or Country: If you use country Groups, you can select the appropriate one here. Otherwise, select your country. Federal State: Select the state this fiscal position will apply to. Zip Range: To further refine the taxes applied, enter a zip code range for the state. Under the Tax Mapping tab, you'll be indicating which broader-defined tax will be mapped to this fiscal position. Click Add an item to specify which tax should be replaced: Tax on Product : The tax you are replacing. Tax to Apply : The tax you would like to apply for this fiscal position. Legal Notes: Write in legal mentions that have to be printed on the invoices here. Under the Account Mapping tab, you can remap an associated product tax account within this fiscal position. This is not commonly used. When you've configured your Fiscal Position, click Save . Good to Know! \u00b6 Detect Automatically? Good News! \u00b6 If Detect Automatically is selected on the form for a Fiscal Position, every partner with an address that contains that Country, Country Group, State, or Zip Code Range (whichever was configured) will have this fiscal position applied. There is no need to additionally apply the Fiscal Position to a Contact. Applying a Fiscal Position to a Contact \u00b6 Navigate to the Contacts app. Click the contact you'd like to add a fiscal position for, then click Edit . Under the Sales & Purchases tab, select the appropriate entry from the Fiscal Position drop-down. When you've set the contact's Fiscal Position, click Save . Managing Tax Exemption with Fiscal Positions \u00b6 It is possible to use Fiscal Positions to manage tax exemption on sales. Any product that should be taxed should have a tax named ' Product Sales Tax '. By creating a new 'Tax Exempt' fiscal position that is not mapped to a tax rate, and another that is designated for the required state tax, new orders will be assigned the appropriate rate as needed. Any additional tax requirements will be applied by the customer's location. To illustrate this ruleset, the following use case outlines a typical reseller tax configuration: The fiscal position Tax Exempt does not have a tax rate applied. The contact Bakery Essentials has been assigned the Tax Exempt fiscal position. Now, when creating a quotation or sale order, the product sales tax will be applied, but because there is no applicable rate, no tax will be collected. Good to Know! \u00b6 Change Fiscal Position on the Quotation/Sale Order \u00b6 You can always change a Fiscal Position on your Quotation or Sale Order under the Other Info tab. This will apply to this record only and will not update the contact. Once changed, the items under Order Lines will update automatically. And, of course, you can do the same on an RFQ or Purchase Order under the Other Information tab.","title":"Fiscal Position"},{"location":"01_application_guide/20_accounting/10_bank_cash/28_fiscal_position/#configuration","text":"The PerfectWORK Accounting software provides a space for the menu Fiscal Positions, which can be accessed under the Accounting section of the Configuration tab.

To ease and speed up the reconciliation process, you can configure Reconciliation Models , which are particularly useful with recurrent entries such as bank fees. Note Reconciliation Models are also useful to handle Cash Discounts . Please refer to this documentation for more information. Types of Reconciliation Models \u00b6 \u00b6 There are three types of Reconciliation Models: Write-off Button Suggestion of counterpart values Match existing invoices/bills Manually create a write-off on clicked button \u00b6 \u00b6 When you are reconciling an entry with an Open Balance , you can use the buttons available under the Manual Operations tab to pre-fill all the values automatically, before validating the reconciliation. Each button is a different Reconciliation Model. Suggest counterpart values \u00b6 \u00b6 This type of Reconciliation Model suggests immediately counterpart values that only need to be validated. This automation is based on a set of rules defined in the reconciliation model. Match existing invoices/bills \u00b6 \u00b6 This type of Reconciliation Model automatically selects the right Customer Invoice or Vendor Bill that matches the payment. All that is left to do is to validate the entry. This automation is based on a set of rules defined in the reconciliation model. Configuration \u00b6 \u00b6 To manage or create new Reconciliation Models , go to . Alternatively, you can also open this menu from the Accounting Overview, by going to your Bank Journal card, clicking on the three little dots, and then on Reconciliation Models . Important The first entry, named Invoices Matching Rule , is the one responsible for the current matching of invoices and bills. Therefore, it is advised to leave it at the top of the list and not to delete it. Open the model you want to modify, or click on Create to create a new one, then fill out the form. Type \u00b6 \u00b6 See above for an explanation about the different types of Reconciliation Models. Note If the Documents application is installed on your database, an additional Activity type field appears when To check is ticked. Selecting the value Reconciliation request implies that, whenever you use this model, a Request Document window pops up to request a document from a user. Conditions on Bank Statement Line \u00b6 \u00b6 Define here all the conditions that are required for a Reconciliation Model to be applied. Important If a record matches with several Reconciliation Models, the first one in the sequence of models will be applied. The sequence is simply the order of the models in the list view . They can be rearranged by dragging-and-dropping the handle next to the name. Counterpart Values \u00b6 \u00b6 This section comprises the values that are applied by the Reconciliation Model. If the value to reconcile needs to be written-off in two separate accounts, click on Add a second line . Purpose \u00b6 The purpose of this documentation is to go over the different reconciliation models in the Accounting application of Odoo 15. Reconciliation in this case refers to the process of ensuring that the items on your business's bank statement are reconciled (linked) to activities in your business. You can use a reconciliation model to manually reconcile bank statement lines to the correct account without needing to select it from the Accounts drop-down menu. Click here to read more about the reconciliation process itself. Processes \u00b6 To get started, navigate to the Accounting app. To get to the reconciliation models, either select the : icon on the bank Kanban card from the Account Overview page and select Reconciliation Model or under Configuration > Reconciliation Models . From the Reconciliation Models details list view, click the CREATE button to make a new one. Reconciliation Models have 3 different Types that create different results: Button to generate counterpart entry button \u00b6 Name : Create a name for this Reconciliation Model.

A Journal Entry, also referred to as an accounting entry, is a formal record that documents a transaction in a Journal . In Odoo, journal entries are made by utilizing the double entry bookkeeping system. Double Entry Bookkeeping Systems require you to make at least one debit line and at least one credit line for each entry. In addition, the totals of the credit side and the debit side of an entry must be of equal value. In Odoo, these credit and debit lines that make up Journal Entries are called Journal Items. Processes \u00b6 To get started, navigate to the Accounting application. Creating a Journal Entry Manually \u00b6 In Odoo, there are numerous operations that can lead to the creation of a journal entry, such as customer invoices, payments, vendor bills, bank statements, stock moves, payslips, etc. However, sometimes it is necessary to create journal entries manually, like when setting up your initial account balances or recording an adjusting journal entry. To get to your Journal Entries, click Accounting > Journal Entries . You will see a list view of journal entries, typically filtered to show only those related to the 'Miscellaneous' journal. Click the Create button to open a form view and begin a new entry. On the next screen, you will be prompted to fill in the following fields: Draft or Number: This segment identifier pre-fills automatically based on the 'Short Code' set on the selected journal, the year of the accounting date, the month of the accounting date, and the next available record number for that period in that journal. Reference: Enter a description of the journal entry's purpose; this will appear on the journal entry itself. Accounting Date: This is the date that you want the entry to be shown as being done on. It is automatically set to the current date, but should be changed, as appropriate. Journal: Select the journal to which you'd like to add this entry. All journal entries require a journal to be selected. In the Journal Items tab you will add Journal Item lines. You will always need a minimum of two lines, at least one for debit amounts and at least one for credit amounts. Click the Add a line button to add a journal item line. You will be prompted to fill in the following information: Account: Select the account from which you will be making the debit/credit from the drop down menu. This is required for all Journal Items. Partner: Select any associated partners for this Journal Line, if applicable. Label: Input a description of the debit/credit line for internal reference. Analytic Account: Choose a relevant Analytic Account, if desired. Analytic Tags: Choose a relevant Analytic Tag, if desired. Debit: The value of the debit. (Skip if this line is for a credit entry.) Credit: The value of the credit. (Skip if this line is for a debit entry.) Continue adding as many journal items as needed. When finished, make sure that the totals of the Debit and Credit amounts are equal. When ready, hit the Save button. You will notice that the entry has not yet been posted, and is in the Draft (or unposted) state. This adds another step of validation before actually posting the entry to your journal and gives you time to ensure that everything has been entered correctly. When the entry is complete and correct, click the Post button to commit the entry and change the status to Posted . Once your Journal Entry has been posted, it will be included by default in the accounting and financial reports such as the General Ledger report. Go to ACCOUNTING > LEDGERS > GENERAL LEDGER (Note: There are options when running the reports to include unposted entries as well.) Reversing a Journal Entry \u00b6 Navigate to the journal entry you wish to reverse. Once you're on the journal entry, click Reverse Entry . A Reverse Moves modal will appear and you will give you the option to fill in the below: Reversal Date: Select between the options of Specific or Journal Entry Date for the date you want the reversal entry to Post. Specific : This option allows you to set the date of the reversing entry to any open accounting period. It will be set to the current date by default, but should be changed as needed. Journal Entry Date : This option will use the original date of the entry to post the reversing entry. Use Specific Journal : If you would like to use a specific journal to record the reversal that is different from the Journal this entry was originally posted to, you can select an alternate journal from this dropdown. If this field is left blank, it will use the Journal the entry was originally posted to. When ready, hit the REVERSE button. Once reversed, you will see the entry that has been created in the system.

We will also provide some example journal entries from common stock moves at the end of this document. Process \u00b6 To get started, navigate to the Accounting app. Overview \u00b6 Odoo creates stock movement journal entries when storable products are being received into your stock from a virtual location or are leaving your stock and going to a virtual location. For example, receiving storable stock from a vendor, shipping storable stock to a customer, or moving storable stock to a virtual scrap location would all trigger stock movement journal entries, as long as the necessary settings were configured prior to those moves occurring. Moving storable stock between internal locations does not create stock movement journal entries because the net value of your storable stock is not increasing or decreasing, the stock is just changing locations within your organization. Product Category Configuration \u00b6 Odoo does not create stock movement journal entries for you by default. To enable this behavior, you will need to make sure that your product categories are configured correctly. Click Configuration > management > Product Categories . This page will show you all of your current product categories. Select the product category ALL . From within this category, click Edit . We'll review just a few settings on this page. Inventory Valuation Costing Method: This is how Odoo calculates the value of your inventory. Your costing method selection will not impact when the creation of stock movement journal entries occurs. Odoo gives you three costing methods to choose from: Standard Price: This allows you to set the costs of your goods sold manually. First In First Out (FIFO): This will calculate your costs based on selling your oldest goods first. Average Cost (AVCO): This will calculate the average cost of your entire inventory at the receipt and assign that average cost to all of your goods. Inventory Valuation: Select Automated . If this is not selected, no stock movement journal entries will be created. Account Stock Properties: This is where you will select the accounts that should be debited and credited for your stock movements. Stock Valuation Account: This is the account used to track the total value of your inventory within your warehouse(s). Stock Journal: This is the journal into which your stock move journal entries will be recorded. Stock Input Account: This is the account used to track the value of your incoming goods before they are processed into your inventory. Stock Output Account: This is the account used to track the value of your outgoing goods, either products that got sold to customers or products that you are moving out of your stock for other reasons like scrapping. Once you've made the necessary changes on this page, click save . Important! \u00b6 Take some time to go through all of your product categories and make sure that your Inventory Valuation is set to Automated, and check that you have the correct accounts and journal set for your accounting. Product Configuration \u00b6 Individual products also have an impact on whether stock movement journal entries are created. Stock movement journal entries will only be created if your product is designated as a Storable Product . Good to Know! \u00b6 Consumable + Service Products \u00b6 Consumable products and service products have accounting implications but do not trigger stock movement journal entries. There are several ways to access your products, but in the Accounting app, you can click Customers > Products or Vendors > Products . The only difference between these views is the preset filter in the search field. On this page, you'll see a full product listing. Click Group By > Product Type . This will sort your products into their product types so that you can check to make sure that your current configuration will make the necessary journal entries when products are moved. Click the Storable Product type heading, then click into a product to review the category and accounting journal configuration. Once there, click Edit . Ensure the following fields are correct under the GENERAL INFORMATION tab. Product Type: This will be set as \"Storable Product\"; a product in which you can manage stock. Product Category: Set to a category that is designated for Automated Inventory Valuations, as specified in the section above. Under the Accounting tab in the Payables section, you also have the option to select specific accounts to track the value of any transfers on the product itself. If there are no accounts set on the product, they will inherit the accounts set on the product category. When you've made your changes, click Save . Location Configuration \u00b6 Locations also have implications for stock movement journal entries. Remember that stock movement journal entries are created when storable products move between an internal location and a virtual location. So, ensuring that your locations are designated correctly as either Virtual or Internal is important. (Note: Locations are optional, and you will only see them listed if that option has been selected in the configuration.) To get started, navigate to the Inventory app. You can see the type of each entry under the Location Type column. With the exception of the \"View\" location, which is only for display purposes, all virtual locations within Odoo (listed below) will create a stock movement journal entry on a transfer. Vendor Location Customer Location Inventory Loss Production Transit Location You can also set your accounts on the location itself. For example, a scrap location could associate a specific account for tracking the value of all incoming and outgoing scrapped goods. To review this example, select the Virtual Locations/[Your Company]: Scrap from your location list. On the details page, click Edit . You will see that the Inventory Loss location type has its own Accounting Information section which will utilize the accounts you specify in this area to track the value entering and leaving this location. Good to Know! \u00b6 The only other location type that allows you to input Accounting Information is 'Production', which is also very important to set up with a Work in Process (WIP) account. Example Journal Entry: Incoming Stock Picking \u00b6 This example journal entry was made from an inbound stock-picking generated by purchase order. After we completed the stock-picking, the products were moved into our stock and the journal entry was created. You can see a credit to the Stock Interim (Received) account and a debit to the Stock Valuation account. This is because as the value is entering our warehouse and adding value to our stock value, it is leaving the interim account used to hold the value of our pending incoming transfers. Example Journal Entry: Outgoing Stock Picking \u00b6 This example journal entry was made from an outbound stock-picking generated by a sales order from a customer. Once we completed the stock-picking from our inventory, this journal entry was made. You can see a credit to the Stock Valuation account and a debit to the Stock Interim (Delivered) account. This is because the value is leaving our stock and is going outbound to a customer, so we have to remove value from our stock and move it into the account used to track outbound goods. Example Journal Entry: Inventory Adjustment \u00b6 Inventory adjustments are necessary when human error occurs and the actual quantity on hand doesn't match the recorded quantity on hand in Odoo. The following journal entry was made from an inventory adjustment after we discovered that we had more of a particular product on hand than the system said we did. You'll see that the Stock Interim (Received) account was credited and the Stock Valuation account was debited to correct for the additional inventory. Example Journal Entry: Manufacturing Order \u00b6 The following journal entries were made when we processed a manufacturing order. When you move component products from your stock to your production location, it will create a journal entry. Likewise, once the finished product is produced, you will have a journal entry for the move out of your production location back into your inventory. Important! \u00b6 You will only have stock movement journal entries for Manufacturing Orders if your component product(s) and finished product(s) are set as storable products and are in a product category that is set for Automated Inventory Valuation . If your component product(s) or the finished product(s) are consumable, or in a product category that is set for Manual Valuation , then you will not have any journal entries for their movements.","title":"Stock Movement"},{"location":"01_application_guide/20_accounting/10_bank_cash/01_journal_entries/02_stock_movement/#purpose","text":"This document describes which configurations on products, product categories, and locations impact stock movement journal entries, and how Odoo 15 can automatically create stock movement journal entries for you in real-time.

Odoo gives you three costing methods to choose from: Standard Price: This allows you to set the costs of your goods sold manually. First In First Out (FIFO): This will calculate your costs based on selling your oldest goods first. Average Cost (AVCO): This will calculate the average cost of your entire inventory at the receipt and assign that average cost to all of your goods. Inventory Valuation: Select Automated .

We will show examples of both sending payment to a vendor and receiving payment from a customer as well as how to create payments manually. Process \u00b6 To get started, navigate to the Accounting app. Journals and Accounts \u00b6 The accounts that will be impacted by registering payments will always be taken from the journal's default debit/default credit accounts and the partner's Accounts Receivable/Accounts Payable (AR/AP) accounts listed on their contact. We will look at the journal's accounts first. Navigate to the journal that you want to post your payment to by clicking Configuration > Accounting > Journals . In this example, we will post a payment to our 'Old Bank' journal. On the Journal Entries tab. For this journal, the Bank Account is set to \"Bank\" and the Suspense Account is set to \"Bank Suspense Account\". Suspense Account : Bank statement transactions are posted to the suspense account until reconciled with a corresponding payment on a vendor bill or customer invoice. This allows the accountant to easily track discrepancies and further separate remaining reconciliation tasks by the journal. First, let's look at Incoming Payments tab. Like all journal entries, the account used on a transaction's incoming payments will be when a payment is being received.Click Add a line to enter a payment method. Payment Method /Name: Manual: Get paid by any method outside of Odoo. Payment Aquiriers : Each payment acquirer has its own Payment Method. Request a transaction on/to a card thanks to a payment token saved by the partner when buying or purchasing online. Batch Deposit: Collect several customer checks at once generating and submitting a batch deposit to your bank. Module account_batch_payment is necessary. SEPA Direct Debit : Get paid in the SEPA zone thanks to a mandate your partner will have granted to you. Module account_sepa_ is necessary.

The other half of the journal entry will be determined by the accounts listed on the partner's AR/AP found on their contact record. Accessing Contacts \u00b6 To access your vendors, navigate to Vendors > Vendors . To access your customers, navigate to Customers > customers . In this view, you will see that when selecting a Vendor, Odoo filters to Vendor Bills . Choose the partner that you want to associate with your payment. Navigate to the accounting tab for the partner and click the Accounting tab. The accounts listed as their Account Receivable and Account Payable will be used for payments associated with this partner. If you see the message \"Accounting-related settings are managed on the parent company \", click the parent company link displayed. These fields can only be viewed/changed on a parent contact. Incoming customer-type payments use the partner's Account Receivable . Outgoing vendor-type payments use the partner's Account Payable . Manually Create a Vendor Payment (Outgoing) \u00b6 It's best practice to create a payment directly from the vendor bill; however, Odoo does allow you to create vendor payments. To do so, click Vendors > Payments , then click create . This will bring you to a form with the following fields. Internal Transfer: This field is to be used for moving funds from one internal account to another. It is not applicable when paying a vendor bill. Payment Type: Send will already be selected because you accessed this form through the Vendors menu. Vendor: Enter the name of the vendor. Amount: Input the payment amount and currency. Date: Select the date that the payment should be recorded. Memo: Input a reference for the payment, we recommend using the vendor bill number associated with this payment. Journal: Select the Journal that the payment will be posted to. Payment Method Manual: This means that the payment was sent or received by a method outside of Odoo like a credit card payment or PayPal receipt. NACHA : Select this to pay by ACH (ACH and NACHA are essentially the same)-Electronic system that moves e-payments from one bank account to another). Check: This means that a check was used to make or receive this payment and can be recorded within Odoo. If you use check printing within Odoo, you can have Odoo print the check for this payment. When selected, the following fields display in the previous section. Vendor Bank Account This field will only appear when the Payment Method is set to \"Manual\". If the vendor you've selected has one or more bank accounts on file, you'll have the option to select their account here. When you're done, click SAVE to keep this record as a draft, or click CONFIRM . Once confirmed, you can then click reset to draft , or Mark as Sent to record that the manual payment has been sent. Journal Entry Sent Payment \u00b6 Once your payment is confirmed, we can review the journal entry that was created by clicking on the Journal Entry smart button. Here you can see that we credited $100.00 from the account that was listed as the Outstanding Payments account on our \"Bank\" journal and we debited the account that was listed as the default Accounts Payable account on the vendor's accounting tab.

Whether you want to accept a single payment for a single invoice, or process a payment spanning multiple invoices and taking discounts for early payments, you can do so efficiently and accurately. From Draft Invoice to Profit and Loss \u00b6 If we pick up at the end of a typical \u2018order to cash\u2019 scenario, after the goods have been shipped, you will: issue an invoice; receive payment; deposit that payment at the bank; make sure the Customer Invoice is closed; follow up if Customers are late; and finally present your Income on the Profit and Loss report and show the decrease in Assets on the Balance Sheet report. Invoicing in most countries occurs when a contractual obligation is met. If you ship a box to a customer, you have met the terms of the contract and can bill them. If your supplier sends you a shipment, they have met the terms of that contract and can bill you. Therefore, the terms of the contract is fulfilled when the box moves to or from the truck. At this point, PerfectWORK supports the creation of what is called a Draft Invoice by Warehouse staff. Invoice creation \u00b6 Draft invoices can be manually generated from other documents such as Sales Orders, Purchase Orders,etc. Although you can create a draft invoice directly if you would like. An invoice must be provided to the customer with the necessary information in order for them to pay for the goods and services ordered and delivered. It must also include other information needed to pay the invoice in a timely and precise manner. Draft invoices \u00b6 The system generates invoice which are initially set to the Draft state. While these invoices remain unvalidated, they have no accounting impact within the system. There is nothing to stop users from creating their own draft invoices. Let\u2019s create a customer invoice with following information: Customer: Agrolait Product: iMac Quantity: 1 Unit Price: 100 Taxes: Tax 15% The document is composed of three parts: the top of the invoice, with customer information, the main body of the invoice, with detailed invoice lines, the bottom of the page, with detail about the taxes, and the totals. Open or Pro-forma invoices \u00b6 An invoice will usually include the quantity and the price of goods and/or services, the date, any parties involved, the unique invoice number, and any tax information. \u201cValidate\u201d the invoice when you are ready to approve it. The invoice then moves from the Draft state to the Open state. When you have validated an invoice, PerfectWORK gives it a unique number from a defined, and modifiable, sequence. Accounting entries corresponding to this invoice are automatically generated when you validate the invoice. You can see the details by clicking on the entry in the Journal Entry field in the \u201cOther Info\u201d tab. Send the invoice to customer \u00b6 After validating the customer invoice, you can directly send it to the customer via the \u2018Send by email\u2019 functionality. A typical journal entry generated from a validated invoice will look like as follows: Account Partner Due Date Debit Credit Account Receivable Agrolait 01/07/2021 115 Taxes Agrolait 15 Sales 100 Payment \u00b6 In PerfectWORK, an invoice is considered to be paid when the associated accounting entry has been reconciled with the payment entries. If there has not been a reconciliation, the invoice will remain in the Open state until you have entered the payment. A typical journal entry generated from a payment will look like as follows: Account Partner Due Date Debit Credit Bank Agrolait 01/07/2021 115 Accounts Receivable Agrolait 01/07/2021 115 Receive a partial payment through the bank statement \u00b6 You can manually enter your bank statements in PerfectWORK, or you can import them in from a csv file or from several other predefined formats according to your accounting localisation. Create a bank statement from the accounting dashboard with the related journal and enter an amount of $100 . Reconcile \u00b6 Now let\u2019s reconcile! You can now go through every transaction and reconcile them or you can mass reconcile with instructions at the bottom. After reconciling the items in the sheet, the related invoice will now display \u201cYou have outstanding payments for this customer. You can reconcile them to pay this invoice. \u201c Apply the payment. Below, you can see that the payment has been added to the invoice. Payment Followup \u00b6 There\u2019s a growing trend of customers paying bills later and later. Therefore, collectors must make every effort to collect money and collect it faster. PerfectWORK will help you define your follow-up strategy. To remind customers to pay their outstanding invoices, you can define different actions depending on how severely overdue the customer is. These actions are bundled into follow-up levels that are triggered when the due date of an invoice has passed a certain number of days. If there are other overdue invoices for the same customer, the actions of the most overdue invoice will be executed. By going to the customer record and diving into the \u201cOverdue Payments\u201d you will see the follow-up message and all overdue invoices. Customer aging report: \u00b6 The customer aging report will be an additional key tool for the collector to understand the customer credit issues, and to prioritize their work. Use the aging report to determine which customers are overdue and begin your collection efforts. Profit and loss \u00b6 The Profit and Loss statement displays your revenue and expense details. Ultimately, this gives you a clear image of your Net Profit and Loss. It is sometimes referred to as the \u201cIncome Statement\u201d or \u201cStatement of Revenues and Expenses.\u201d Balance sheet \u00b6 The balance sheet summarizes your company\u2019s liabilities, assets and equity at a specific moment in time. For example, if you manage your inventory using the perpetual accounting method, you should expect a decrease in account \u201cCurrent Assets\u201d once the material has been shipped to the customer.","title":"Customer Invoice to Payments Collection"},{"location":"01_application_guide/20_accounting/20_accounts_receivable/#from-draft-invoice-to-profit-and-loss","text":"If we pick up at the end of a typical \u2018order to cash\u2019 scenario, after the goods have been shipped, you will: issue an invoice; receive payment; deposit that payment at the bank; make sure the Customer Invoice is closed; follow up if Customers are late; and finally present your Income on the Profit and Loss report and show the decrease in Assets on the Balance Sheet report.

Payment terms designate the schedule to pay the full balance of an invoice. You can apply payment terms to both your customer and vendor invoices. You can set payment terms on a contact, quotation, sale order, customer invoice, request for quotation, purchase order, or vendor bill. Creating a Payment Term \u00b6 Once there, click on Configuration > Invoicing > Payment Terms . Here you'll see a list of existing payment terms, which you can view and edit. To create new payment terms, click Create and complete the form as follows. Payment Terms : The name of your payment terms. Typically summarizes the payment schedule for that payment term. Company : This field displays in a multi-company environment. You can leave the field blank to apply to all companies, or make a selection to apply to one company only. Description on the Invoice: You can input a description of the payment terms conditions in more detail in the description so that your customers will understand the conditions to complete payment. Terms: These lines represent the schedule for a set portion of the invoice's amount. To set the terms, you will need to add a new line for every condition. As you add or edit lines, you can use the icon to the left of a line (Only accessible when in Edit mode in the Payment Term) to move it up or down, by clicking and dragging. This will be helpful because your last line should be the 'Balance' line that. the system pre-fills for you. To add a new line, click ADD A LINE and a popup modal will appear. You'll then see a new form where you'll outline your first payment term. We'll go over each option: Term Type Type: There are three types of terms that you can use to construct your payment terms. The type is the amount that is due for this line. Balance : The total remaining balance to be paid. You will enter the value of the balance once you close the modal. You will use this for the last line of the terms. Percent : Input a percentage of the total balance to be paid based on the total amount of purchase. Fixed Amount : Input a fixed dollar amount. Due Date Computation : This is where you input when the amount you specified above is due. You'll have three options: Due ____: Indicate the number of days or the ordinal day of the month (e.g 1 st , 15 th , 30 th ) that the invoice is due. This distinction is dependent on the option that is selected. Days after the invoice date : This defines how many days a payment is due based on the invoice date. One the ___ of the month : This option is only available is Days after the invoice date is selected. This allows you to select a specific ordinal day of the month in which this payment is due (e.g. 1 st , 15 th , 30 th ). Days after the end of the invoice month : This defines how many days the payment is due after the end of the invoice month. Of the following month : This defines the ordinal day of the following month when the payment is due (e.g.1 st , 15 th , 30 th ). Of the current month : This degines the ordinal day of the current month when the payment is due (e.g. 1 st , 15 th , 30 th ). Once you have these fields set, you can click SAVE & CLOSE if you only need one line. If you need multiple lines, you can click SAVE & NEW to save your existing line and get a new line to appear without leaving the modal. Once you have your payment terms set and in the desired order, click SAVE . End With a Balance \u00b6 When creating a payment term with multiple lines, it is crucial that the last one is for the Balance . This is to ensure the invoice will be paid in full and you won't be left with only a partial payment, or an overpayment. Layaway Example \u00b6 For our example, we've created a layaway plan which requires a 25% down payment and 25% every 30-days for 3 months. Important The down payment is the first entry. It shows that 25% of the total price is due 0 days after the invoice is created (i.e. same day). The next payment is the second entry. It shows that 25% of the total price is due 30 days after the invoice is created. The next payment is the third entry. It shows that 25% of the total price is due 60 days after the invoice is created. The final line is a call for the Balance. We could have simply added another 25% line, but sometimes the totals don't amortize into equal amounts. Configuring the Balance as the final line ensures you'll be paid the appropriate amount. Applying Payment Terms \u00b6 Setting Default Payment Terms On Contacts \u00b6 You may have certain customers that you have an agreement with on their payment terms. Once you've created the Payment Terms that will apply, you'll need to then apply it to their contact record to ensure the terms apply to sales moving forward. To do so, open a contact record. (There are many ways to access contact records, but for this example, we will stay in the Accounting app and look at Customers.) In the Accounting app, click CUSTOMERS > CUSTOMERS . From the list of partners, select the contact to set the payment terms for. Click Edit then navigate to the Sales & Purchases tab. On this tab, you'll see if your contact is a customer, vendor, or both and can apply payment terms to the contact as needed. When you're done, click SAVE . Applying Payment Terms On Invoices \u00b6 If you'd like to set Payment Terms on a customer invoice, While still in the Accounting app, go to CUSTOMERS > INVOICES , then create a new invoice by clicking CREATE . Due Date: Set the customer on the invoice. If there are any payment terms associated with the customer, they will display automatically in the payment terms field. This can be changed manually if needed. If the customer does not have default payment terms, or if you removed them from the invoice, you will have an option to set a specific due date or to choose the appropriate payment terms from the drop-down menu. Proceed with creating the rest of the invoice, then click SAVE and POST when ready. Applying Payment Terms to Quotations & Sales Orders \u00b6 If you'd like to set Payment Terms per sale, then you'll want to do so through the Quotation or Sales Order itself. To get started, navigate to the Sales app. Once there, click create to make a new Quotation. Set the customer you are generating the Sale Order for. If there are default payment terms associated with the customer, they will display automatically in the payment terms field. This can be changed manually if needed. If the customer does not have payment terms set for them, you can choose the correct payment terms from the drop-down menu. Proceed with creating the rest of the Sales Order or Quotation, then hit SAVE and confirm when ready. Applying Payment Terms on Purchase Orders \u00b6 If you're making a purchase from one of your vendors that has payment terms, PerfectWORK lets you define those terms as well, to keep your payments on track. To define payment terms on a purchase order, first navigate to the Purchase app. Once there, click create to make a new Request for Quotation. Set the vendor you are creating the Purchase Order for, then navigate to the Other Information tab and you'll see the Payment Terms field. If there are any payment terms associated with the vendor, they will display automatically in the payment terms field and can be changed as needed. If the vendor does not have payment terms set for them, you can choose the correct payment terms manually. Fill in the remaining details for the Request for Quotation or Purchase Order. When ready, click SAVE , CONFIRM ORDER , or SEND BY EMAIL . Payment Terms and Reporting \u00b6 Aged Receivable \u00b6 We've created a Sales Order for a customer on the Layaway plan we created earlier in this document. The total purchase price is $400,000. They have agreed to pay us 25% today, then 25% at 30 days and 60 days, then at the 90-day mark they will pay the balance. This is what the invoice looks like: To review Aged Receivables, navigate to the Accounting app. Once there, navigate to Reporting > Partner Reports > Aged Receivable . Here you can see that PerfectWORK has created three lines for the invoice, due at the agreed intervals under the customer, not including the payment made on the day the order was made: Aged Payable \u00b6 In the example below, we entered a vendor bill with a total of $300.00 and we have agreed to pay 50% upon ordering, then the final payment in 15 days. This is what the vendor bill looks like.: To review Aged Payables, navigate to the Accounting app. Once there, navigate to Reporting > Partner Reports > Aged payable . Here you can see that PerfectWORK has created vendor bills due under the appropriate vendor. The first is the day the order is placed, the final is due in 15 days. Incoterms in Accounting \u00b6 Incoterms is an abbreviation of International Commercial Terms , its sole purpose is to facilitate the transaction between two parties exporting and importing goods regarding international and global trade. There are 11 Incoterms, each defines the distribution of responsibilities and obligations of the involved parties. In the Accounting app, navigate to Configuration > Settings . Under Customer Invoices , you may select a Default Incoterm for your company. Use Incoterms in a Vendor Bill \u00b6 Navigate to Vendors > Bills and click Create . Under the Other Info tab you will have the ability to manually set the Incoterm , if you have already set a Default Incoterm , this field will show the pre-selected Incoterm. Use Incoterms in a Customer Invoice \u00b6 Navigate to Customers > Invoices and click CREATE .

Reconciliation also refers to ensuring that the items on your business's bank statement are reconciled (i.e. linked) to activities in your business. In this document, we'll review the different ways to reconcile or unreconcile payments in the Accounting application of Odoo 15 in the following sections: Reconciling with Bank Statements Using Payment Matching Settling an Invoice on Partial Payment Cancelling Reconciled Payments Process \u00b6 To get started, navigate to the Accounting app. Reconciling with Bank Statements \u00b6 In order to reconcile your bank account with Odoo, you'll need to have unreconciled statements. If you manually enter or import your statements, be sure to do that first. If your account is set to sync automatically, then depending on your synchronization frequency, you may choose to sync again before getting started, so you'll have the most updated transactions Then, from the journal card, use the menu to navigate to Statements . Once you're on the bank statement page, you'll see all of the bank statements that have been added into Odoo either manually or through any automatic bank synchronization that you have set up. For more information on setting up your bank statements, please see the Setting up a Bank Account document. Select the bank statement that you would like to reconcile. On the statement, you'll see all of your bank transactions in a form view. Review the information on this page, then click Post . Next, click reconcile to begin the reconciliation process. Odoo Match Suggestions \u00b6 On the reconciliation page, Odoo will make suggestions for transactions that match. The line in blue is the match that Odoo is suggesting. You can then confirm the match by clicking Validate . Continue through the list until all of your transactions have been matched. When you're done, Odoo will give you a big kudos in the form of Rainbow Guy. If you're done reconciling the entire statement, click Go to Bank Statements . Use the breadcrumbs to go back to bank statements. Then click Validate . Your statement is now fully reconciled. Using Payment Matching \u00b6 You should always attempt to record a payment directly from the invoice, or record a vendor payment directly from the bill. This is how it works in a perfect world; however, there will be times when you'll have transactions entered independently of their counterparts. That's where Payment Matching comes in. It's important to note that Payment Matching is unrelated to your bank statement reconciliation, and simply lets you link transactions together. In our example, Superstar Inc came in with a check. They didn't know which invoice they were paying, only that they owed $690. We wanted to quickly get thim a receipt, so we received the payment into Odoo while they waited, but didn't link it to an invoice because we were short on time. We've since received and imported our bank statement including this transaction, now we need to match them up! From Customers > Payments , let's find the payment received from Superstar Inc. From within this payment record, click the Payment Matching smart button. Good to Know! \u00b6 We'll occasionally refer to a T Sheet when talking about reconciliation. A T sheet is a form used in double-entry accounting. As in the example shown, there's a \"T\" on the page with the account is listed on the top (whether asset or liability). Then, the debit entries are in the left column and the credit entries in the right column. The goal is for both columns to balance. Here, of the reconcilable lines for this partner are displayed on a T sheet. Click validate when the columns are balanced and the correct transactions are matched. Good to Know! \u00b6 You can use a Reconciliation Model to manually reconcile bank statement lines to the correct account without needing to select it from the Accounts drop-down menu. See our documentation on Reconciliation Models for more information and details. Settling an Invoice on Partial Payment \u00b6 There may be times when a partial payment will be sufficient to settle an invoice. This may be based on things like specific payment terms, or a verbal agreement. It's important to first understand Reconciliation Models . Creating a \"Write-Off\" model will provide a button under the Manual Operations tab allowing you to quickly write off the balance of an invoice and maintain control over where those funds are recorded. In this example, we've agreed to settle the full bill of a customer if they pay today. From their payment record, we opened Payment Matching and added the total due ( \\(948.75) and the payment (\\) 900) to the T Sheet. Once we do this, Odoo assumes it's a partial payment and adjusts the invoice to match. Since we're writing the balance off, we'll need to set that back to the original amount by clicking the icon. Next, click the line that was added for \"Open Balance\". For the remaining balance (-$48.75), we'll click Write Off , which is a Reconciliation Model we've created just for this purpose. This will populate the appropriate fields with the settings from the Write Off Reconciliation Model , and add the $23.51 offset to the T sheet. We can then click validate . The original invoices will now show as paid in full. And, the written off total has been added to the journal that records such things. Canceling Reconciled Payments \u00b6 From the Bank Statement \u00b6 To reverse reconciliation on any reconciled bank statement line, you'll first need to reset to processing . Then, click edit followed by Revert Reconciliation to the far-right of each transaction you'd like to unreconcile. This will set the transaction to unreconciled and allow you to re-reconcile that line to the appropriate no journal item. From a Paid Invoice \u00b6 Open the paid invoice from Customers > Invoices , then scroll to the totals area. Click the information icon and you'll have the option to unreconcile .","title":"Reconciliation"},{"location":"01_application_guide/20_accounting/20_accounts_receivable/66_reconciliation/#process","text":"To get started, navigate to the Accounting app.","title":"Process"},{"location":"01_application_guide/20_accounting/20_accounts_receivable/66_reconciliation/#reconciling-with-bank-statements","text":"In order to reconcile your bank account with Odoo, you'll need to have unreconciled statements.

Usually, draft invoices are created by the system (with information coming from other documents like sales order or contracts) and accountant just have to validate draft invoices and send the invoices in batch (by regular mail or email). Depending on your business, you may opt for one of the following way to create draft invoices: Sales \u00b6 Sales Order \u2023 Invoice \u00b6 In most companies, salespeople create quotations that become sales order once they are validated. Then, draft invoices are created based on the sales order. You have different options like: Invoice manually: use a button on the sale order to trigger the draft invoice Invoice before delivery: invoice the full order before triggering the delivery order Invoice based on delivery order: see next section Invoice before delivery is usually used by the eCommerce application when the customer pays at the order and we deliver afterwards. (pre-paid) For most other use cases, it\u2019s recommended to invoice manually. It allows the salesperson to trigger the invoice on demand with options: invoice the whole order, invoice a percentage (advance), invoice some lines, invoice a fixed advance. This process is good for both services and physical products. Sales Order \u2023 Delivery Order \u2023 Invoice \u00b6 Retailers and eCommerce usually invoice based on delivery orders, instead of sales order. This approach is suitable for businesses where the quantities you deliver may differs from the ordered quantities: foods (invoice based on actual Kg). This way, if you deliver a partial order, you only invoice for what you really delivered. If you do back orders (deliver partially and the rest later), the customer will receive two invoices, one for each delivery order. eCommerce Order \u2023 Invoice \u00b6 An eCommerce order will also trigger the creation of the order when it is fully paid. If you allow paying orders by check or wire transfer, PerfectWORK only creates an order and the invoice will be triggered once the payment is received. Contracts \u00b6 Regular Contracts \u2023 Invoices \u00b6 If you use contracts, you can trigger invoice based on time and material spent, expenses or fixed lines of services/products. Every month, the salesperson will trigger invoice based on activities on the contract. Activities can be: fixed products/services, coming from a sale order linked to this contract materials purchased (that you will re-invoice) time and material based on timesheets or purchases (subcontracting) expenses like travel and accommodation that you re-invoice to the customer You can invoice at the end of the contract or trigger intermediate invoices. This approach is used by services companies that invoice mostly based on time and material. For services companies that invoice on fix price, they use a regular sales order. Recurring Contracts \u2023 Invoices \u00b6 For subscriptions, an invoice is triggered periodically, automatically. The frequency of the invoicing and the services/products invoiced are defined on the contract. Others \u00b6 Creating an invoice manually \u00b6 Users can also create invoices manually without using contracts or a sales order. It\u2019s a recommended approach if you do not need to manage the sales process (quotations), or the delivery of the products or services. Even if you generate the invoice from a sales order, you may need to create invoices manually in exceptional use cases: if you need to create a refund If you need to give a discount if you need to change an invoice created from a sales order if you need to invoice something not related to your core business Specific modules \u00b6 Some specific modules are also able to generate draft invoices: membership: invoice your members every year repairs: invoice your after-sale services Resequencing of the invoices \u00b6 It remains possible to resequence the invoices but with some restrictions: The feature does not work when entries are previous to a lock date. The feature does not work if the sequence is inconsistent with the month of the entry. It does not work if the sequence leads to a duplicate. The order of the invoice remains unchanged. It is useful for people who use a numbering from another software and who want to continue the current year without starting over from the beginning.","title":"Customer Invoice"},{"location":"01_application_guide/20_accounting/20_accounts_receivable/01_customer_invoices/#sales","text":"","title":"Sales"},{"location":"01_application_guide/20_accounting/20_accounts_receivable/01_customer_invoices/#sales-order-invoice","text":"In most companies, salespeople create quotations that become sales order once they are validated.

Process \u00b6 To get started, navigate to the Accounting app. From the Accounting Overview , you will see a kanban view of your journals. Customer Invoices will have smart buttons for Invoices that need to be validated/sent to the customer, unpaid invoices, and quick totals of each. You will also have the option to create a new invoice manually or by import. Click CUSTOMERS > INVOICES for a list of all invoices, as well as the option to create and upload new records. Important! \u00b6 Start with a Sale Order \u00b6 Odoo has an automated checks-and-balances approach with most applications. For this reason, you should always aim to create invoices and payments from the original sales order. Doing so will keep the records linked so Odoo can apply payments, credits, stock moves, etc. all within the same realm of that original transaction. Creating manual invoices and payments for existing records can cause more work in the future because those original orders would then need to be updated manually. Creating Invoices \u00b6 Creating a Manual Invoice \u00b6 To create an invoice manually, click Customers > Invoices , then click Create . On the New Invoice form, fill out the fields as follows. Customer: Select the customer to be invoiced. Delivery Address: This field should auto-populate with the customer's delivery location. Reference: Enter the reference number(s) for the sales order(s) being invoiced against. Invoice Date: Enter the date the invoice was created. Due Date or Terms: Determine the due date for the invoice or select predefined terms (e.g. 15 days, 30 days) from the drop-down menu. Journal : The Journal where entries for this invoice are recorded. The second drop down menu on this line is to define the currency which will auto-populate with the default currency for your company. Under the Invoice Lines tab, you can add a specific item by clicking Add a Line , then enter the items or services that you'll be invoicing, as well as the quantity and price for each. Notice that you're not required to select a product, but it does make it easier to match invoices to sale orders if you decide to go this route. If you don't select a product, you'll need to provide a label for the invoice line, as shown below. Under the journal items tab, the fields will be pre-populated with the accounts on the product template; however, you can modify or Add a Line if necessary. Under the Other Info tab: Invoice Customer Reference: This field will auto-populate a reference to be used when registering payments through the invoice record, with the Register payment function Salesperson: Select the employee responsible for this invoice. Sales Team: Select the Sales Team this invoice is assigned to. Recipient Bank : The bank account number to which the invoice will be paid. Referrer : The person who you can refer to regarding the invoice Accounting Company : This will auto-populate with the company Incoterm: Pre-defined commercial terms used in international transactions. Fiscal Position: Define the taxes that should be applied for this customer, IE state-specific tax rules. Intrastat Country: System for collecting information and producing statistics on dispatches and arrivals of goods between countries. Post Automatically: If checked, this invoice will post on its date. To Check: If checked, it indicates the user was not sure about the information entered and is requesting an admin to review before confirming. When you're done, click Save to keep the invoice in draft status. Click confirm to confirm that it's ready for payment. You can click SEND & PRINT so your customer will have access to the invoice, and the ability to make payments. Move to the next section to register a payment on an invoice! Creating an Invoice from a Sales Order \u00b6 When creating invoices, this is the recommended method because it keeps your documents in sync. To get started, navigate to the Sales app. Under the To Invoice > ORDERS TO INVOICE . This will take you to an overview of sales orders that need to be validated and billed in order to receive payment. Click the order you wish to invoice. Good to Know! \u00b6 Pro-Forma Invoice \u00b6 If enabled, you can Send Pro-Forma Invoice instead. A Pro-forma invoice is an estimate provided in advance of the delivery of goods. They are commonly used as quotations and are not a demand for payment. This will bring up a modal window where you'll have three options before creating the invoice. Regular Invoice: This will include all un-invoiced lines on the order. Down Payment (percentage): Invoices a percentage of the total on order, leaving the remainder to be invoiced at a later date. Down Payment (fixed amount): Invoices the down payment line alone to take an initial payment. Timesheet Period : Timesheets not yet invoiced from this period will be invoiced. If these fields are left blank, all timesheets not yet invoiced will be invoiced without distinction. Click Create and View Invoice to immediately review the invoice. Good to Know! \u00b6 'Create Invoice' Button \u00b6 The Create Invoice button on this modal window will create the invoice and redirect you back to the list view. This is a time-saving feature for batch work! Click confirm to confirm the invoice and make it eligible for payment. Combining Invoices \u00b6 Often customers will ask for one combined invoice, which is very easily accomplished. First, navigate to the Sales app. Here you'll see a modal window that displays the total number of invoices being combined. Click Create and View Invoice . This brings you to a view of each of the individual invoices lines from each invoice you just created. Click confirm to post it. At that point, you'll be able to register payments against the amount due.","title":"Invoicing Process"},{"location":"01_application_guide/20_accounting/20_accounts_receivable/01_customer_invoices/01_invoicing_process/#purpose","text":"This document will cover the general workflow of creating an Invoice, registering a payment for it, and dividing a lump sum payment across several invoices within the Odoo 15 Accounting application.","title":"Purpose"},{"location":"01_application_guide/20_accounting/20_accounts_receivable/01_customer_invoices/01_invoicing_process/#process","text":"To get started, navigate to the Accounting app. From the Accounting Overview , you will see a kanban view of your journals.

A Credit Note (sometimes called a Credit Memo) is issued to the customer, notifying them that a credit for a certain amount has been sent to them as a document. There are several events that may lead to issuing a credit note, including the return of goods or rejection of a service, a mistake on the invoice, or delivered goods being damaged. Process \u00b6 To get started, navigate to the Accounting app. Important! \u00b6 Issuing a Credit Note is the only legal way to change, cancel, or refund a validated invoice. Remember to Register the Payment if you need to return money to the customer! We can manually record a credit note through Customers > Credit Notes ; however, we recommend recording it directly from the posted, paid invoice. To do so, go to Customers > Invoices and select the invoice to issue a credit note on. From within the invoice, click ADD CREDIT NOTE . This brings up the Credit Note modal window, which we'll cover next. Good to Know! \u00b6 Partial Refund vs Full Refund? \u00b6 When an invoice is marked as Paid or In Payment, the only option for a credit note is for a Partial Refund. The other credit note types are only accessible on invoices that have not been paid. An example for issuing a full refund on an invoice with an outstanding balance due might be that your company is giving a credit on that order, to the customer, for one reason or another. Another example might be that you need to modify the invoice because the price listed was incorrect and you can not reset the invoice to Draft. If a period that an invoice is in is locked, you wouldn't be able to modify that invoice, but you could still issue a credit against it, and then make a new draft record to modify and report the original invoice. Partial Refund Credit Notes \u00b6 With a Partial Refund, Odoo will create a Draft profiled with the necessary information from the referenced or original invoice. The following modal will open with the Credit Method already set and is not able to be modified. Credit Method: Select 'Partial Refund'. This type of credit note is created as a draft and can be edited before being issued. Reason: Enter a reason for the credit note, if desired. Reversal Date Specific: Marking this box allows you to choose the Refund Date in the corresponding field. Journal Entry Date: Marking this box will issue the credit note on the same date the payment was made. Choosing this option will remove the Refund Date field. Use Specific Journal : To record the credit note to a journal different from the one where the payment was recorded, select that journal here. Refund Date: This is the date for when the refund is being issued. Click REVERSE when complete. This will create the Draft Credit Note where you can then click CONFIRM . This will move the draft to the Posted state, and reflect the credit note as Outstanding debits , or partial payments, near the total due, which can be applied to the invoice as payment. Note in the breadcrumbs that the new posted reference number begins with an 'R,' and is followed by the original invoice reference. Full Refund Credit Notes \u00b6 When creating a Full Refund, Odoo automatically creates and validates a credit note, and reconciles the original invoice to it. This is the option to choose if you need to do a full refund or cancel an already validated invoice. In this section, we have chosen an invoice that has already posted. Click ADD CREDIT NOTE . This will give us the same pop up window with the same options as the Partial Refund, though this time, we will select ' Full Refund ', complete the form, then click REVERSE when ready. If we now look at the amount due at the bottom of the invoice, we will see the icon.

You can have multiple payments linked to the same invoice. If a payment is not linked to an invoice, the customer has an outstanding credit with your company, or your company as an outstanding balance with a vendor. You can use this outstanding credit/debit to pay future invoices or bills. Paying an invoice \u00b6 If you register a payment on a customer invoice or a vendor bill, the payment is automatically reconciled with the invoice reducing the amount due. The green icon near the payment line will display more information about the payment. From there you can choose to open the journal entry or reconcile the payment. Note If you unreconcile a payment, it is still registered in your books but not linked to the specific invoice any longer. If you unreconcile a payment in a different currency, PerfectWORK will create a journal entry to reverse the Currency Exchange Loss/Gain posted at the time of reconciliation. Payments not tied to an invoice \u00b6 Registering a payment \u00b6 In the Accounting application, you can create a new payment from the Sales menu (register a customer payment) or the Purchases menu (pay a vendor). If you use these menus, the payment is not linked to an invoice, but can easily be reconciled on an invoice later on. When registering a new payment, you must select a customer or vendor, the payment method, and the amount of the payment. The currency of the transaction is defined by the payment method. If the payment refers to a document (sale order, purchase order or invoice), set the reference of this document in the memo field. Once confirmed, a journal entry will be posted reflecting the transaction just made in the accounting application. Reconciling invoice payments \u00b6 The easiest way of reconciling a payment with an invoice is to do so on the invoice directly. When validating a new invoice, Odoo will warn you that an outstanding payment for this customer or vendor is available. In this case, you can reconcile this payment to the invoice near the totals at the bottom, under \u201cOutstanding Payments\u201d. Reconciling all your outstanding payments and invoices \u00b6 If you want to reconcile all outstanding payments and invoices at once (instead of doing so one by one), you can use the batch reconciliation feature within Odoo. The batch reconciliation feature is available from the dashboard on the Customer Invoices card and the Vendor Bills card for reconciling Accounts Receivable and Payable, respectively. The payments matching tool will open all unreconciled customers or vendors and will give you the opportunity to process them all one by one, doing the matching of all their payments and invoices at once. During the reconciliation, if the sum of the debits and credits do not match, it means there is still a remaining balance that either needs to be reconciled at a later date, or needs to be written off directly. Transferring money from one bank account to another \u00b6 Just like making a customer or vendor payment, you transfer cash internally between your bank accounts from the dashboard or from the menus up top. This will take you to the same screen you have for receiving and making payments. Note When making an internal transfer from one bank account to another, select the bank you want to apply the transfer from in the dashboard, and in the register payments screen, you select the transfer to account. Do not go through this process again in the other bank account or else you will end up with two journal entries for the same transaction.","title":"Register Payment"},{"location":"01_application_guide/20_accounting/20_accounts_receivable/02_customer_payment/01_different_way_payment/#paying-an-invoice","text":"If you register a payment on a customer invoice or a vendor bill, the payment is automatically reconciled with the invoice reducing the amount due.

We'll go over registering full payments and partial payments. We'll also cover payment matching when applying a manual payment to several invoices. Processes \u00b6 To get started, navigate to the Accounting app. Registering Full Payments on a Customer Invoice \u00b6 Click customers > invoices . Once there, filter for Posted + Unpaid to find an invoice in the payable state. Select an invoice from the list. From within the invoice, click Register Payment . A pop-up modal to register payment will appear. Enter the following information: Journal: The journal to which the payment should be registered. Payment Method Manual: Select this to get paid by cash, check or any other method outside of Odoo. Batch Deposit: Select this to encase several customer checks at once by generating a batch deposit to submit to your bank. SEPA Direct Deposit : Select this to allow a creditor to collect funds from your bank account provided that you have a signed mandate and it has been granted by you the customer. Recipient Bank Account: The field label is misleading; this represents the customer's account that funds are being drawn from and is an optional field. Amount/Currency: This is set to the full amount by default, so we'll leave it as-is for this example. The currency will auto-populate with the set default currency, though it can be changed. Payment Date: The date on which the payment was made. Memo: This is set to the Invoice number by default, but can be changed. A common use case for this field is the check number for the check by which payment was made. When finished, click create payment . Once the payment is validated, you'll see the IN PAYMENT banner on the top-right of the invoice. Once the payment has been confirmed by the bank, the banner will change to PAID . The Amount Due at the bottom of the invoice will also be updated and the payment will be logged with a date. You can click the small info button to the left of the payment line to see the payment details. To view more details, click VIEW . To remove this payment from the invoice, click UNRECONCILE . Registering Partial Payments on a Customer Invoice \u00b6 Click CUSTOMERS > INVOICES . Once there, filter for Posted + Unpaid to find an invoice in the payable state. Select an invoice from the list. From within the invoice, click Register Payment . A pop-up modal to register payment will appear. Enter the following information: Journal : The journal to which the payment should be registered. Payment****Method Manual : Select this to get paid by cash, check, or any other method outside of Odoo. Batch****Deposit : Select this to encase several customer checks at once by generating a batch deposit to submit to your bank. SEPA Direct Deposit: Select this to allow a creditor to collect funds from your bank account provided that you have a signed mandate and it has been granted by you the customer. Recipient Bank Account : The field label is misleading; this represents the customer's account that funds are being drawn from and is an optional field. Amount/Currency : This is set to the full amount by default. Adjust it to the partial payment amount being made. The currency will auto-populate based on your default currency. Payment Date : The date on which the payment was made. Memo : This is set to the Invoice number by default, but can be changed. A common use case for this field is the check number for the check by which payment was made. Payment Difference : When you enter a partial payment, Odoo will ask what you want to do with the remaining balance. You'll have two options: Keep open : Select this option for this example as we expect to collect the balance due at a later date. Mark invoice as fully paid : We'd select this option if we want to consider this invoice settled and will write off the balance. When doing so, you'll be required to select the account to post the difference, as well as add a label/reason for the difference. When finished, click create payment . Once the payment is validated, you'll see the PARTIAL banner added. Notice that you still have the option to register payment on the invoice. You'd use this option to add another full or partial payment. The Amount Due at the bottom of the invoice will also be updated and the payment will be logged with a date. Click the small info button to the left of the payment line to see the payment details. To view more details, click VIEW . To remove this payment from the invoice, click UNRECONCILE . Manual Invoice Payments + Payment Matching \u00b6 As a rule, you should always make a payment directly from the invoice; however, there may be times when the payment is made manually. For example, a customer may write a check to pay off the entire balance of several different invoices. We need to register that payment manually, then distribute it across each invoice. From Customers > Invoices , we then filtered for invoices that were \"unpaid\" for this customer. From our results, we see that our customer, Superstar, still has outstanding invoices in the amount of $690, and they have sent a bulk payment for this amount. Let's register the payment. To do so, go to Customers > Payments , then click create . On the modal window, we'll enter the following details: Internal Transfer: This is to be used when funds are being transferred from account to account; it's unlikely you'll be using this to record a customer payment. Payment Type : Select \"Receive Money\". Customer: Select the customer making the payment. Amount: The amount of the payment. Date: The date when the payment was received. Memo: You can enter the invoice numbers as a reference to what this payment will apply to; however, this is for reference purposes only. It does not link the payment to any invoice(s). Journal: Select the Journal where this transaction will be recorded. Payment Method: Select \"Manual\" unless this payment is being made with several types of payment methods. Customer Bank Account: The field label is misleading; this represents the customer's account that funds are being drawn from and is an optional field. When ready, click CONFIRM . After confirming, you'll be in the validated payment record. Click the Payment Matching smart button. From here you'll see the payment we just recorded listed. Click the payment entry to add it to the T Sheet. Next, click each related invoice to add them to the T Sheet. You can use the search field to narrow down what's displayed in this list. When both columns balance, click Reconcile . Note that this button turns solid when the columns balance. If you reconcile items that don't balance, you'll need to account for the difference. This payment hs now been applied to all selected invoices, and we can confirm this by navigating back to the invoice using the breadcrumbs. Then, click the Invoices smart button to see invoices associated with this payment. Here we see all of the invoices that this payment applied to. Notice the Payment Status shows In Payment . This will update as soon as the payment is confirmed with the bank. Good to Know! \u00b6 Register Payment on Multiple Invoices \u00b6 If you know which invoices a manual payment is being registered on, you can do it directly from the Invoice listing page. Select the invoices to apply the payment to, then click Register Payment . This brings up a modal window with minimal, pre-populated fields. Click Create Payment . All selected invoices will then be marked In Payment until the payments are verified by the bank, then they will be marked as Paid . Batch Payments \u00b6 As a rule, you should always make a payment directly from the invoice; however, there may be times when the payment is made manually. For example, our customer, Deco Addict, has written a check to pay off the entire balance of several different invoices. We just need to register that payment manually, then distribute it across each invoice. This follows the same workflow as above for manual payments. From Customers > Invoices , we then filtered for invoices that were \"unpaid\" for this customer. From our results, we see that our customer, Deco Addict, still has several outstanding invoices, and they have sent a bulk payment for the total amount. Let's register the payment.

From Vendor Bill to Payment \u00b6 Record a new vendor bill \u00b6 When a vendor bill is received, you can record it from Purchases \u2023 Vendor Bills in the Accounting application. As a shortcut, you can also use the New Bill feature on the accounting dashboard. To register a new vendor bill, start by selecting a vendor and inputting their invoice as the Vendor Reference , then add and confirm the product lines, making sure to have the right product quantities, taxes and prices. Save the invoice to update the pre tax and tax amounts at the bottom of the screen. You will most likely need to configure the prices of your products without taxes as PerfectWORK will compute the tax for you. Note On the bottom left corner, PerfectWORK shows a summary table of all taxes on the vendor bill. In several countries, different methods are accepted to round the totals (round per line, or round globally). The default rounding method in PerfectWORK is to round the final prices per line (as you may have different taxes per product. E.g. Alcohol and cigarettes). However if your vendor has a different tax amount on their bill, you can change the amount in the bottom left table to adjust and match. Validate The Vendor Bill \u00b6 Once the vendor bill is validated, a journal entry will be generated based on the configuration on the invoice. This journal entry may differ depending on the the accounting package you choose to use. For most European countries, the journal entry will use the following accounts: Accounts Payable: defined on the vendor form Taxes: defined on the products and per line Expenses: defined on the line item product used For Anglo-Saxon (US) accounting, the journal entry will use the following accounts: Accounts Payable: defined on the vendor form Taxes: defined on the products and per line Goods Received: defined on the product form You can check your Profit & Loss or the Balance Sheet reports after having validated a couple of vendor bills to see the impact on your general ledger. Pay a bill \u00b6 To create a payment for an open vendor bill directly, you can click on Register a Payment at the top of the form. From there, you select the payment method (i.e. Checking account, credit card, check, etc\u2026) and the amount you wish to pay. By default, PerfectWORK will propose the entire remaining balance on the bill for payment. In the memo field, we recommend you set the vendor invoice number as a reference (PerfectWORK will auto fill this field from the from the vendor bill if set it correctly). Note You can also register a payment to a vendor directly without applying it to a vendor bill. To do that, Purchases \u2023 Payments. Then, from the vendor bill you will be able to reconcile this payment with directly. Printing vendor Checks \u00b6 If you choose to pay your vendor bills by check, PerfectWORK offers a method to do so directly from your vendor payments within PerfectWORK. Whether you do so on a daily basis or prefer to do so at the end of the week, you can print in checks in batches. If you have checks to print, PerfectWORK\u2019s accounting dashboard acts as a to do list and reminds you of how many checks you have left to be printed. By selecting the amount of checks to be printed, you can dive right into a list of all payments that are ready to be processed. Select all the checks you wish to print (use the first checkbox to select them all) and set the action to Print Checks . PerfectWORK will ask you to set the next check number in the sequence and will then print all the checks at once. Reporting \u00b6 Aged payable balance \u00b6 In order to get a list of open vendor bills and their related due dates, you can use the Aged Payable report, under the reporting menu, (in Reporting \u2023 Business Statement \u2023 Aged payable ) to get a visual of all of your outstanding bills. From here, you can click directly on a vendors name to open up the details of all outstanding bills and the amounts due, or you can annotate any line for managements information. At any point in time while you\u2019re looking through the report, you can print directly to Excel or PDF and get exactly what you see on the screen.","title":"Vendor Bill to Payment"},{"location":"01_application_guide/20_accounting/30_account_payable/#from-vendor-bill-to-payment","text":"","title":"From Vendor Bill to Payment"},{"location":"01_application_guide/20_accounting/30_account_payable/#record-a-new-vendor-bill","text":"When a vendor bill is received, you can record it from Purchases \u2023 Vendor Bills in the Accounting application.

It\u2019s a very important aspect of a business as the inventory can be the biggest asset of a company. Inventory valuation implies two main choices: - The cost method you use to value your goods (standard, fifo, avco) - The way you record this value into your accounting books (manually or automatically) Those two concepts are explained in the sections below.

Process \u00b6 To get started, navigate to the Accounting app. Configuring a Deferred Revenue Account \u00b6 Important! \u00b6 Automating Deferred Revenues? \u00b6 In the sections below, we'll go over Deferred Revenue Models, which provides for the automation of deferred revenue journal entries. If you plan to use the automated method, you'll need to create a separate account for each Deferred Revenue Model due to the unique configuration of each. Go to Configuration > Accounting > Chart of Accounts . Click create to open a new line. Enter the Code, Account Name, and Account Type (Current Liabilities). When you're done, click save . Once saved, click Setup on the new account line. From within the record, click Edit , or click on one of the fields in the record to set the record into 'edit' mode. There are two sections to focus on in this account: Type and the Automation (tab). On the Accounting tab you will see: Type : Because this is deferred revenue, the account should be set to Current Liabilities on the previous step. Default Taxes: Set the default tax account. Tags : Assign optional tags for custom reporting. Allowed Journals: Journals in which this account can be used. If left blank, it can be used in all journals. Allow Reconciliation : Check this box to allow invoices and payment matching of journal items. Deprecated : Check this box if the account is no longer used. Group : List any groups that are allowed to view this account. If field is left empty, all users can view it. Company : This will auto-populate with the name of the company you are in. On the Automation tab: Automate Deferred Revenue: This is what will automate the process for us. If you'd like to review the entries before posting them, select 'Create in draft'. If you'd like Odoo to post them directly, select 'Create and validate'. Deferred Revenue Model: In order to automate this process, we need to give the account a model to use. If you haven't created that model yet, no worries, we'll come back to this! (This field is shown when either 'Create' option is chosen. It is required if the 'Create and validate' option is chosen.) When you're ready, click Save . Good to know! \u00b6 You can create a new Deferred Revenue Model from this screen by beginning to type the name of what you would like to call the model and click Create or Create and Edit. Creating a Deferred Revenue Model \u00b6 These configurations are the means by which Odoo automates deferred revenues. Depreciation Method Number of Recognitions: Select the number of units and it's form of measure (e.g. months, years) Prorata Temporis: Indicates that the first automated entry must be done from the purchase date instead of the first date of fiscal period. Accounting Revenue Account: Select the Revenue Account to which this income will be recorded. Deferred Revenue Account: Select the Deferred Revenue Account to which this income will be recorded. For our example, we'll select the account we just created. Journal: Select the journal to which these transactions will be recorded. Only journals with type set as 'Miscellaneous' can be selected. You may create a new journal for these entries if you wish. Analytic Account: If applicable, select the Analytic Account to which these transactions will be recorded. Analytic Tag: If applicable, indicate the tag(s) to be added to transactions that use this model. In the Automation tab, set the Deferred Revenue Model to the model we just created, then click Save . Configuring a Product for Deferred Revenue \u00b6 Next, go to Customers > Products and either create or select a product to configure using the following example as a guideline. We have a product called \"1 Year Adventure Box\" where we send the buyer one box every month for one year. We want to disperse the revenue over the course of 12 months to properly reflect what we're sending out each month. Click on the Accounting tab. Under the Receivables section, set the Income Account to the one you set to be deferred revenue. When you're ready, click Save . Good to Know! \u00b6 Multiple Deferred Revenue Products? \u00b6 If you have several products that should create deferred revenue, consider creating a dedicated category for those products. Doing so allows you to set the category itself to deferred revenue, so all products within it will inherit that setting. Watch it Work! \u00b6 Let's sell this product and watch how it works based on the configuration, above. (We will walk through the full process from Sales Order to Customer Invoice, but all you really need is the Customer Invoice to continue.) Navigate to the Sales app. Once there, we'll go to ORDERS > ORDERS and click CREATE . We'll select a customer and add the '1 Year Adventure Box' product under the ORDER LINES tab. We'll then confirm the order. On the confirmed invoice, click Create Invoice , ...then CREATE AND VIEW INVOICE . Confirm the invoice. Now, let's jump back to the Accounting app. Once there, we'll go to Accounting > Management > Deferred Revenues . Here we'll see our brand new entry in draft status. Click on it to open. From within this record, we can see the configuration of the deferred revenue model has been applied. To see the planned journal entries, we'll click Compute Revenue . You'll now see a new Revenue Board tab with all of those planned entries. If everything looks good, you can go ahead and click confirm . Odoo will now start posting journal entries according to the Revenue Board for the specific date on each line. Create a Manual Deferred Revenue \u00b6 If you're not at the point of needing to automate Deferred Revenues, you can easily create an entry manually. To do so, start in the Accounting app. Once there, we'll go to ACCOUNTING > MANAGEMENT > DEFERRED REVENUES and click Create to bring up the empty form. Deferred Revenue name: Enter a name for this record. Asset Values: Click select the related purchases . This brings up a list of journal items. Here, locate and select the entry for the sale (use filters to help find the entry you are looking for), and click Select . In doing so, several fields on the page will populate for you. Original Value: This is a calculated field that pulls directly from the record(s) you selected in the previous step. Acquisition Date: The date of revenue acquisition. Depreciation Method Number of Recognitions: Select the number of units and measure of units (e.g. months, years). Prorata Temporis: Indicates that the first automated entry must be done from the purchase date instead of the first date of fiscal period. First Recognition Date: Select the date for the first journal entry to be made. Current Values Residual Amount to Recognize: This is a calculated field that displays the amount left to defer. Deferred Revenue Amount: This is a calculated field that displays the amount deferred up until the current date. Accounting Revenue Account: Select the account to recognize the revenue. Deferred Revenue Account: Select the account to recognize the deferred revenue. Journal: Select the journal to record enteries for this deferred revenue entry.

Odoo will now start posting journal entries according to the Revenue Board. Good to Know! \u00b6 Create a Deferred Revenue Model from a Manual Entry \u00b6 If you've created a manual deferred revenue entry that you think will be useful in the future, go ahead and click Save Model to save this configuration for future use!

Fixed Assets are items that a company purchases for long-term use (more than one year) and are not likely to be quickly liquidated into cash. Fixed Assets can include: Computer/Office Equipment Vehicles Production Equipment/Machinery Furniture Fixed Assets then undergo depreciation, at a determined schedule, to reflect within financial reporting the decreasing value of the asset. Items that are held in inventory are not typically fixed assets, as they are purchased with the intent of resale to earn revenue. Example \u00b6 If your company purchases a computer for employee use, this is a Fixed Asset because it was paid for by the company and will be utilized over a relatively long period of time with no plans for reselling. Process \u00b6 To get started, navigate to the Accounting app. Creating Asset Models \u00b6 Once there, click Configuration > management > Asset models . You will see a list view of all existing Asset Models. Click the Create button to create a new Asset Model. In the form that displays, configure the fields according to your needs and the guidelines below. Asset Model Name: Give the asset model a name to represent the type of asset being depreciated (e.g. Computer, Delivery Truck). Depreciation Method Method: Straight Line: This is the most common method and the easiest to calculate. With this method, the initial residual value is divided equally by number of planned entries. Declining: This method multiplies the last residual value by a chosen declining factor. Declining then Straight Line: This method is a combination of Straight Line and Declining. It follows the Declining method until the Straight Line method gives a higher amount, then it switches to Straight Line values. This allows you to claim higher amounts earlier in the life of the asset. Declining Factor : (Does not apply to Straight Line depreciation) Specify a factor to calculate the reduction for each planned entry. Duration: This figure is set by the IRS, so you'll need to refer to their documentation and enter the correct duration. Prorata Temporis: When selected, the value of the first depreciation entry will be made based on when the asset is purchased. Accounting Fixed Asset Account: The account used to record the purchase of the asset at its original price. Depreciation Account: The account used in the depreciation entries, to decrease the asset values. Expense Account: The account used in the periodical entries, to record a part of the asset expense. Journal: The Journal that will record the asset entries, you may only select from journals with the type set as 'Miscellaneous' journal. You may create a separate journal for these entries if you wish. Analytic Account: An optional field, applying an Analytic Account provides additional reporting. Analytic Tag : Relevant keywords used for reporting and organization. Good to Know! \u00b6 If you would like to set up an expense account specifically for depreciation, it's fast and easy! When editing the Asset Model, enter the name of the new account in the Expense Account field, choose the \"Create and Edit\" option that appears below, then fill in the appropriate fields. Code: Expense accounts in Odoo are typically in the 220000 sequences by default (though your system may be different), so start the code with 2200 and then add an incremented value to avoid a code collision. Account Name: Name it something descriptive. In this case, 'Depreciation Expense Account'. Type: Depreciation Tags: Operating Activities Click Save and you'll be brought back to editing your Asset Type. Example \u00b6 Based on this Asset Type configuration, we can expect the following to happen each time we purchase this Asset Type: An asset for the item will be created and automatically confirmed. The value of the item will be made in the Asset Account. A debit entry in the Depreciation Expense Account will be made every year, starting on the day the purchase is made, for five years. Each entry will be for the same amount (with small variations, to account for numbers that are not evenly divisible by the number of entries). Creating an Asset \u00b6 Go to Vendors > Bills . Here you will see a list view of all Vendor Bills. Click the CREATE button to create a new vendor bill for the asset that was purchased. As with all Vendor Bills, select or create the vendor from which you're purchasing the asset, then click the Add a Line link under the Invoice Lines tab. If you want the fixed assets to be created manually, because each one will be very unique or is infrequent, you can do so. Simply skip choosing a product; enter a Label and choose the appropriate Account based on your Asset Model configuration. Don't forget to give the line item a Price , which will be what you paid when purchasing the item. When you're ready, click CONFIRM . Good to Know! \u00b6 Creating an Asset Product \u00b6 We often recommend creating products for assets, which serve as templates through which you can quickly create assets with little variation. To get started, click Vendors > Products and then CREATE . Product Name: Give the product a name that conveys what the item is. Under the General Information tab: Set the Product Type to Consumable . Assign an appropriate category, such as 'Fixed Assets'. Note that this can be a very simple category that uses its parent (All) defaults, as this is for reporting and grouping/filtering purposes only. Under the Accounting tab: In the Payables section, set the Expense Account to your Fixed Asset account. When ready, click Save . Managing Assets \u00b6 Good to Know! \u00b6 Options for Automating Assets \u00b6 Once you have opened up your Fixed Asset account, click Edit . In the Automation tab's Automate Asset section, you'll see three options: These settings directly impact what you'll see in the ACCOUNTING > Management > ASSETS area. No: The asset will not be created automatically. To add it, you'll need to create it manually (outlined below). Create in Draft: When an asset is purchased, it will be listed here in Draft state. You'll need to open and Confirm it to move it to the Running state. (The Asset Model field will appear and be optional.) Create and Validate: When an asset is purchased, it will be listed here in Running state. (The Asset Model field will be required.) If you've made any changes to this account, click Save . Creating an Asset Manually \u00b6 Navigate back to Accounting > Management > Assets , then click Create to open a blank form. In this form, we can manually enter all details, but since we've created a vendor bill for our asset, we'll click Select Related Purchases to make the process easier! You'll then see a modal window where you can filter for, then select the asset you'd like to add. Once you've checked the appropriate box, click Select . Doing this will populate the asset form with the details from the Vendor Bill. Next, you'll need to select the Asset Model from the option(s) at the top of the form. For our example, we'll click Batch mixer . Doing this will populate the fields on the form that are configured in this Asset Model. Be sure you have the proper account set as the Expense Account . When ready, click Confirm . After the page reloads, click the Posted Entries smart button. On this page, you'll see the depreciation amortization that was created. The entries are listed in descending order by date, the first entry at the bottom. Because we selected the Prorata Temporis option, the first entry was prorated ( \\(9,528.77) and the last entry contains the balance (\\) 37,471.23). With this model, these two figures will be equal, or close to equal, to the value of the other depreciation entries. Good to Know! \u00b6 These entries are invoiced via an automated process in Odoo on the date specified. There is no need to manually post them.","title":"Asset Management"},{"location":"01_application_guide/20_accounting/60_management/01_asset_management/#purpose","text":"This documentation outlines the use case and processes associated with Fixed Assets in the Accounting application of Odoo 15.

To make sure they are recorded with accuracy, Odoo\u2019s tax engine supports all kinds of uses and computations. Default taxes \u00b6 \u00b6 Default Taxes define which taxes are automatically selected when there is no other indication about which tax to use. For example, Odoo prefills the Taxes field with the Default Taxes when you create a new product or add a new line on an invoice. To change your Default Taxes , go to , select the appropriate taxes for your default Sales Tax and Purchase Tax , and click on Save . Note Default Taxes are automatically set up according to the country selected at the creation of your database, or when you set up a fiscal localization package for your company. Activate Sales Taxes from the List view \u00b6 \u00b6 As part of your fiscal localization package , most of your country\u2019s sales taxes are already preconfigured on your database. However, only a few of them are activated by default, so that you can activate only the ones relevant for your business. To activate Sale Taxes, go to and use the Activate toggle button to activate or deactivate a tax. Configuration \u00b6 \u00b6 To edit or create a Tax , go to and open a tax or click on Create . Important Taxes have three different labels, each one having a specific use. Refer to the following table to see where they are displayed. | Tax Name | Label on Invoice | Tax Group | | --- | --- | --- | | Back end | Taxes column on exported invoices | Above the Total line on exported invoices | Basic Options \u00b6 \u00b6 Tax Name \u00b6 \u00b6 The Tax Name as you want to display it for backend users. This is the label you see while editing Sales Orders, Invoices, Products, etc. Tax Computation \u00b6 \u00b6 Group of Taxes The tax is a combination of multiple sub-taxes. You can add as many taxes you want, in the order you want them to be applied. Important Make sure that the tax sequence is correct, as the order in which they are may impact the taxes\u2019 amounts computation, especially if one of the taxes affects the base of the subsequent ones . Fixed The tax has a fixed amount in the default currency. The amount remains the same, regardless of the Sales Price. For example, a product has a Sales Price of \\(1000, and we apply a _\\) 10 fixed_ tax. We then have: | Product\u2019s Sales Price | Price without tax | Tax | Total | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | 1,000 | 1,000 | 10 | 1,010.00 | Percentage of Price The Sales Price is the taxable basis: the tax\u2019s amount is computed by multiplying the Sales Price by the tax\u2019s percentage. For example, a product has a Sales Price of $1000, and we apply a 10% of Price tax. We then have: | Product\u2019s Sales Price | Price without tax | Tax | Total | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | 1,000 | 1,000 | 100 | 1,100.00 | Percentage of Price Tax Included The Total is the taxable basis: the tax\u2019s amount is a percentage of the Total. For example, a product has a Sales Price of $1000, and we apply a 10% of Price Tax Included tax. We then have: | Product\u2019s Sales Price | Price without tax | Tax | Total | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | 1,000 | 1,000 | 111.11 | 1,111.11 | Active \u00b6 \u00b6 Only Active taxes can be added to new documents. Important It is not possible to delete taxes that have already been used. Instead, you can deactivate them to prevent future use. Note This field can be modified from the List View . See above for more information. Tax Scope \u00b6 \u00b6 The Tax Scope determines the tax\u2019s application, which also restricts where it is displayed. Sales : Customer Invoices, Product\u2019s Customer Taxes, etc. Purchase : Vendor Bills, Product\u2019s Vendor Taxes, etc. None Tip You can use None for taxes that you want to include in a Group of Taxes but that you don\u2019t want to list along with other Sales or Purchase taxes. Definition tab \u00b6 \u00b6 Allocate with precision the amount of the taxable basis or percentages of the computed tax to multiple accounts and Tax Grids. Based On : Base: the price on the invoice line % of tax: a percentage of the computed tax. Account : if defined, an additional Journal Item is recorded. Tax Grids : used to generate Tax Reports automatically, according to your country\u2019s regulations. Advanced Options tab \u00b6 \u00b6 Label on Invoices \u00b6 \u00b6 The label of the tax, as displayed on each invoice line in the Taxes column. This is the label visible to front end users, on exported invoices, on their Customer Portals, etc. Tax Group \u00b6 \u00b6 Select to which Tax Group the tax belongs. The Tax Group name is the label displayed above the Total line on exported invoices, and the Customer Portals. Tax groups include different iterations of the same tax. This can be useful when you must record differently the same tax according to Fiscal Positions . In the example above, we see a 0% tax for Intra-Community customers in Europe. It records amounts on specific accounts and with specific tax grids. Still, to the customer, it is a 0% tax. That\u2019s why the Label on the Invoice indicates 0% EU , and the Tax Group name, above the Total line, indicates 0% . Include in Analytic Cost \u00b6 \u00b6 With this option activated, the tax\u2019s amount is assigned to the same Analytic Account as the invoice line. Included in Price \u00b6 \u00b6 With this option activated, the total (including the tax) equals the Sales Price . Total = Sales Price = Computed Tax-Excluded price + Tax For example, a product has a Sales Price of $1000, and we apply a 10% of Price tax, which is included in the price . We then have: | Product\u2019s Sales Price | Price without tax | Tax | Total | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | 1,000 | 900.10 | 90.9 | 1,000.00 | Note Invoices : By default, the Line Subtotals displayed on your invoices are Tax-Excluded .

But, when you work in a B2B environment, companies usually negotiate prices with taxes excluded. Odoo manages both use cases easily, as long as you register your prices on the product with taxes excluded or included, but not both together. If you manage all your prices with tax included (or excluded) only, you can still easily do sales order with a price having taxes excluded (or included): that\u2019s easy. This documentation is only for the specific use case where you need to have two references for the price (tax included or excluded), for the same product. The reason of the complexity is that there is not a symmetrical relationship with prices included and prices excluded, as shown in this use case, in belgium with a tax of 21%: Your eCommerce has a product at 10\u20ac (taxes included) This would do 8.26\u20ac (taxes excluded) and a tax of 1.74\u20ac But for the same use case, if you register the price without taxes on the product form (8.26\u20ac), you get a price with tax included at 9.99\u20ac, because: 8.26\u20ac * 1.21 = 9.99\u20ac So, depending on how you register your prices on the product form, you will have different results for the price including taxes and the price excluding taxes: Taxes Excluded: 8.26\u20ac & 10.00\u20ac Taxes Included: 8.26\u20ac & 9.99\u20ac Note If you buy 100 pieces at 10\u20ac taxes included, it gets even more tricky. You will get: 1000\u20ac (taxes included) = 826.45\u20ac (price) + 173.55\u20ac (taxes) Which is very different from a price per piece at 8.26\u20ac tax excluded. This documentation explains how to handle the very specific use case where you need to handle the two prices (tax excluded and included) on the product form within the same company. Note In terms of finance, you have no more revenues selling your product at 10\u20ac instead of 9.99\u20ac (for a 21% tax), because your revenue will be exactly the same at 9.99\u20ac, only the tax is 0.01\u20ac higher. So, if you run an eCommerce in Belgium, make your customer a favor and set your price at 9.99\u20ac instead of 10\u20ac. Please note that this does not apply to 20\u20ac or 30\u20ac, or other tax rates, or a quantity >1. You will also make you a favor since you can manage everything tax excluded, which is less error prone and easier for your salespeople. Configuration \u00b6 \u00b6 Introduction \u00b6 \u00b6 The best way to avoid this complexity is to choose only one way of managing your prices and stick to it: price without taxes or price with taxes included. Define which one is the default stored on the product form (on the default tax related to the product), and let Odoo compute the other one automatically, based on the pricelist and fiscal position. Negotiate your contracts with customers accordingly. This perfectly works out-of-the-box and you have no specific configuration to do. If you can not do that and if you really negotiate some prices with tax excluded and, for other customers, others prices with tax included, you must: always store the default price tax excluded on the product form, and apply a tax (price excluded on the product form) create a pricelist with prices in tax included , for specific customers create a fiscal position that switches the tax excluded to a tax included assign both the pricelist and the fiscal position to customers who want to benefit to this pricelist and fiscal position For the purpose of this documentation, we will use the above use case: your product default sale price is 8.26\u20ac tax excluded but we want to sell it at 10\u20ac, tax included, in our shops or eCommerce website eCommerce \u00b6 \u00b6 If you only use B2C or B2B prices on your website, simply select the appropriate setting in the Website app settings. If you have both B2B and B2C prices on a single website, please follow these instructions: Activate the developer mode and go to . Open either Technical / Tax display B2B or Technical / Tax display B2C . Under the Users tab, add the users requiring access to the price type. Add B2C users in the B2C group and B2B users in the B2B group. Setting your products \u00b6 \u00b6 Your company must be configured with tax excluded by default. This is usually the default configuration, but you can check your Default Sale Tax from the menu of the Accounting application. Once done, you can create a B2C pricelist. You can activate the pricelist feature per customer from the menu: of the Sale application. Choose the option different prices per customer segment . Once done, create a B2C pricelist from the menu . It\u2019s also good to rename the default pricelist into B2B to avoid confusion. Then, create a product at 8.26\u20ac, with a tax of 21% (defined as tax not included in price) and set a price on this product for B2C customers at 10\u20ac, from the menu of the Sales application: Setting the B2C fiscal position \u00b6 \u00b6 From the accounting application, create a B2C fiscal position from this menu: . This fiscal position should map the VAT 21% (tax excluded of price) with a VAT 21% (tax included in price) Test by creating a quotation \u00b6 \u00b6 Create a quotation from the Sale application, using the menu. You should have the following result: 8.26\u20ac + 1.73\u20ac = 9.99\u20ac. Then, create a quotation but change the pricelist to B2C and the fiscal position to B2C on the quotation, before adding your product. You should have the expected result, which is a total price of 10\u20ac for the customer: 8.26\u20ac + 1.74\u20ac = 10.00\u20ac. This is the expected behavior for a customer of your shop. Avoid changing every sale order \u00b6 \u00b6 If you negotiate a contract with a customer, whether you negotiate tax included or tax excluded, you can set the pricelist and the fiscal position on the customer form so that it will be applied automatically at every sale of this customer. The pricelist is in the Sales & Purchases tab of the customer form, and the fiscal position is in the accounting tab. Note that this is error prone: if you set a fiscal position with tax included in prices but use a pricelist that is not included, you might have wrong prices calculated for you. That\u2019s why we usually recommend companies to only work with one price reference.","title":"B2B and B2C Pricing"},{"location":"01_application_guide/20_accounting/70_taxes/05_b2b_b2c_pricing/#configuration","text":"","title":"Configuration\u00b6"},{"location":"01_application_guide/20_accounting/70_taxes/05_b2b_b2c_pricing/#introduction","text":"The best way to avoid this complexity is to choose only one way of managing your prices and stick to it: price without taxes or price with taxes included.

An Analytic Account contains accounting entries but is not bound to legal constraints, meaning you can create a Chart of Analytic Accounts that is completely your own and do with it as you wish. Analytic Accounts are helpful for keeping track of specific costs and revenues. For example, you can make an Analytic Account called 'Administration' to track of all your administrative costs. An analytic account is comprised of Analytic Entries, which are similar to journal entries. These are lines that give you a clear view of your analytic account's costs and revenues, and are generally created when various Odoo documents are validated. You can also create manually analytic Entries. You can use Analytic Tags to further refine analytic entries. For example, you could make tags for different teams in a department, you can then filter the list of analytic entries to view only those with a specific tag.

Several prices per product \u00b6 To apply several prices per product, select Different prices per customer segment in Sales \u2023 Settings. Then open the Sales tab in the product detail form. You can settle following strategies. Prices per customer segment \u00b6 Create pricelists for your customer segments: e.g. registered, premium, etc. Temporary prices \u00b6 Apply deals for bank holidays, etc. Enter start and end dates dates. Tip Make sure you have default prices set in the pricelist outside of the deals period. Otherwise you might have issues once the period over. Prices per minimum quantity \u00b6 Note The prices order does not matter. The system is smart and applies first prices that match the order date and/or the minimal quantities. Discounts, margins, roundings \u00b6 Advanced pricing based on formula allows to set price change rules. Changes can be relative to the product list/catalog price, the product cost price, or to another pricelist. Changes are calculated via discounts or surcharges and can be forced to fit within floor (minimum margin) and ceilings (maximum margins). Prices can be rounded to the nearest cent/dollar or multiple of either (nearest 5 cents, nearest 10 dollars). Once installed go to Sales \u2023 Configuration \u2023 Pricelists (or Website Admin \u2023 Catalog \u2023 Pricelists if you use e-Commerce). Each pricelist item can be associated to either all products, to a product internal category (set of products) or to a specific product. Like in second option, you can set dates and minimum quantities. Note Once again the system is smart. If a rule is set for a particular item and another one for its category, Odoo will take the rule of the item. Make sure at least one pricelist item covers all your products. There are 3 modes of computation: fix price, discount & formula. Here are different price settings made possible thanks to formulas. Discounts with roundings \u00b6 e.g. 20% discounts with prices rounded up to 9.99. Costs with markups (retail) \u00b6 e.g. sale price = 2*cost (100% markup) with $5 of minimal margin. Prices per country \u00b6 Pricelists can be set by countries group. Any new customer recorded in Odoo gets a default pricelist, i.e. the first one in the list matching the country. In case no country is set for the customer, Odoo takes the first pricelist without any country group. The default pricelist can be replaced when creating a sales order. Tip You can change the pricelists sequence by drag & drop in list view. Compute and show discount percentage to customers \u00b6 In case of discount, you can show the public price and the computed discount % on printed sales orders and in your eCommerce catalog. To do so: - Check Allow discounts on sales order lines in Sales \u2023 Configuration \u2023 Settings \u2023 Quotations & Sales \u2023 Discounts . - Apply the option in the pricelist setup form.","title":"Managing Pricing"},{"location":"01_application_guide/30_sales_distribution/06_managing_pricing/#how-to-adapt-your-prices-to-your-customers-and-apply-discounts","text":"PerfectWORK has a powerful pricelist feature to support a pricing strategy tailored to your business.

A multiplied audience and boosted revenue are now just a few clicks away! Each website can work in a fully independent way, with its theme, branding, domain name, header & footer, pages, languages, products, blog, posts, forum, slides, events, live chat channels, etc. Let\u2019s go for a tour! Setup \u00b6 To create a new website, go to :menuselection: Website --> Configuration --> Settings . The button, Create a new website , lays in the first section. In the upcoming prompt, set a name for your new website and a specific domain name. Leave empty to publish the new website under the default domain of your PerfectWORK database. You can later set some country groups to redirect visitors to it using Geo IP. Then, select a theme. This new website might have an entirely different purpose or audience than the first one. So feel free to go for a different theme! Once the theme is selected, you can start to build the homepage of your website. Follow the purple drops; they will help you in the first steps. Note If you run PerfectWORK Online, don\u2019t forget to redirect any new domain name to your PerfectWORK database ( CNAME ) and to authorize it PerfectWORK-side. See :ref: domain-name/existing . Create the menu \u00b6 The new website has a default menu with all the installed applications. To edit it, click :menuselection: Pages --> Edit Menu . Moving forward you only edit the menu of the current website. Switch from one website to another \u00b6 As easy as ABC! There is a website switcher in the right corner of the edit bar. Switching to another website will connect to the domain of this website. If you use another domain for the website, the user is requested to sign in. Note When switching, you are redirected to the same domain path on the other website (e.g., /shop/myproduct ). If this URL is not used, you will be redirected to a 404 page but prompted to create a new page from there. Add features \u00b6 The website apps you install (e.g., Slides, Blogs) are made available on all your websites. You can, of course, keep them hidden in one website by removing the menu item. Each website comes with a high range of specific options in the settings. First, select the website to configure. Then, take a look at the options flagged with the earth icon. It means they only impact the very website you are working on. You can, for instance, set specific : languages, domain names, social media links, customer portal mode (B2C vs. B2B), dedicated live chat channels, etc. The other options are global and apply to all your websites. Manage domain names \u00b6 As said earlier, your websites can either share the same domain name or use a specific one. If you share it and want to adapt the content per region, set country groups in the setting of each website. Visitors will be redirected to the right website using GeoIP. Note Geo IP is installed by default in PerfectWORK Online. If you run PerfectWORK on-premise, don\u2019t forget to install GeoIP library. See :doc: on-premise_geo-ip-installation If you setup an extra website and specify the domain name you will have to do three things to get this feature to work: Setup an A-record in the DNS configuration of your hosting provider so that \" www.mywebsite2.ext \" is redirected to the IP of your PerfectWORK instance. Create an extra Nginx server block in which you set the server_name that you've set in the :guilabel: Website domain field. Reload and restart your Nginx instance to use the new server block. Customize the visitor experience \u00b6 The customer experience can be customized very profoundly thanks to the menu *Customize*. All the visual options available there are specific to each website. Go through the different pages to adapt them to this new audience. Focus on workflows, and automatic pages (eCommerce checkout, blogs, events, etc.) as the number of available options is higher there. Publish specific content per website \u00b6 Like static pages, any content created from the front-end (product, blog post, etc.) is always only published in the current website. You can change that from the edit form view in the backend and leave the Website field blank. This will publish it in all the websites. Here are all the objects that you can link to either one or all the websites : Products Product Categories for eCommerce Blogs Slide Channels Forums Events Job Positions Note When you create the record from the backend and publish it, typically a product or an event, it is made available in all websites. Publish a page in all websites \u00b6 A new static page is created and only made available in the current website. You can duplicate it to other websites from :menuselection: Website --> Configuration --> Pages . To do so, leave the Website field empty. If you want to duplicate it in just one other website, duplicate the page and set the new website. When you edit the page again, the change only affects the current website. A new page is duplicated and tied up to the website. The original page still being linked to all websites. Tip By grouping pages by URL in the page manager, you quickly find the original page behind each edited page. Multi-companies \u00b6 Each website can be linked to a specific company of your system, in a multi-companies environment. With such a configuration, only company-related data appear on the website (products, jobs, events, etc.). Website editors can only view and edit the pages of the records they have access to, typically the ones belonging to their current company (and to their subsidiaries, or child companies in PerfectWORK language). And so is it for visitors. Note If websites are multi-companies, you don\u2019t change company when switching websites. To change the company and see the related content, use the company selector in the menu. Configure your eCommerce website \u00b6 eCommerce is a crucial feature in the multi-websites environment. We made it so that the entire flow can be customized to fit the very audience of each website. Products only available on one website \u00b6 We already saw earlier how to publish a specific record in only one website. You will find the *Website* field in the eCommerce tab of the product edit form. Empty means available in all websites. Products available on some websites \u00b6 To make a product available on some websites, but not all of them, you should duplicate the product for each website. If you need a unique reference to manage in your inventory, you should install Manufacturing and create *Kits BoMs (bills of materials). Each kit will link each published \u201cvirtual\u201d product to the main reference managed in your inventory. That way, any item sold from your website will be converted into the storable item in the delivery order. Pricelists \u00b6 To manage specific prices by websites, you can activate Multiple Sales Prices per Product in Website settings. Then, go to :menuselection: Website --> Products --> Pricelists to create additional pricelists. You can also choose to have a pricelist available only on a specific website. Leaving the field empty means that you make it work in all websites if Selectable is selected. Otherwise, it makes it only available for backend operations of Sales and Point of Sale applications. Payment Providers and Delivery Methods \u00b6 By default, published payment providers and delivery methods are deployed in all websites. You could already use specific payment providers per country using Geo IP by defining countries in their configuration. Now you can also do it per website by filling in the Website field. Customer accounts \u00b6 There is a setting to choose how to manage customer accounts in Website settings. You can either allow customers to use one account through all the websites or compel them to create one account for each website. This last option is convenient if your websites shouldn\u2019t be related to each other in the visitor mind. Technical hints for customization \u00b6 If you want to publish custom objects on the website, here are a few tips to make it work with multi websites: Sitemap: don\u2019t forget the domain in the route to only publish available records in each website\u2019s sitemap. Access: you should call the method can_access_from_current_website in the controller to make sure the visitor can see a record in the current website.

You can, for instance, set specific : languages, domain names, social media links, customer portal mode (B2C vs. B2B), dedicated live chat channels, etc. The other options are global and apply to all your websites. Manage domain names \u00b6 As said earlier, your websites can either share the same domain name or use a specific one. If you share it and want to adapt the content per region, set country groups in the setting of each website. Visitors will be redirected to the right website using GeoIP. Note Geo IP is installed by default in PerfectWORK Online. If you run PerfectWORK on-premise, don\u2019t forget to install GeoIP library. See :doc: on-premise_geo-ip-installation If you setup an extra website and specify the domain name you will have to do three things to get this feature to work: Setup an A-record in the DNS configuration of your hosting provider so that \" www.mywebsite2.ext \" is redirected to the IP of your PerfectWORK instance. Create an extra Nginx server block in which you set the server_name that you've set in the :guilabel: Website domain field. Reload and restart your Nginx instance to use the new server block. Customize the visitor experience \u00b6 The customer experience can be customized very profoundly thanks to the menu *Customize*. All the visual options available there are specific to each website. Go through the different pages to adapt them to this new audience. Focus on workflows, and automatic pages (eCommerce checkout, blogs, events, etc.) as the number of available options is higher there. Publish specific content per website \u00b6 Like static pages, any content created from the front-end (product, blog post, etc.) is always only published in the current website. You can change that from the edit form view in the backend and leave the Website field blank. This will publish it in all the websites. Here are all the objects that you can link to either one or all the websites : Products Product Categories for eCommerce Blogs Slide Channels Forums Events Job Positions Note When you create the record from the backend and publish it, typically a product or an event, it is made available in all websites. Publish a page in all websites \u00b6 A new static page is created and only made available in the current website. You can duplicate it to other websites from :menuselection: Website --> Configuration --> Pages . To do so, leave the Website field empty. If you want to duplicate it in just one other website, duplicate the page and set the new website. When you edit the page again, the change only affects the current website. A new page is duplicated and tied up to the website. The original page still being linked to all websites. Tip By grouping pages by URL in the page manager, you quickly find the original page behind each edited page. Multi-companies \u00b6 Each website can be linked to a specific company of your system, in a multi-companies environment. With such a configuration, only company-related data appear on the website (products, jobs, events, etc.). Website editors can only view and edit the pages of the records they have access to, typically the ones belonging to their current company (and to their subsidiaries, or child companies in PerfectWORK language). And so is it for visitors. Note If websites are multi-companies, you don\u2019t change company when switching websites. To change the company and see the related content, use the company selector in the menu. Configure your eCommerce website \u00b6 eCommerce is a crucial feature in the multi-websites environment. We made it so that the entire flow can be customized to fit the very audience of each website. Products only available on one website \u00b6 We already saw earlier how to publish a specific record in only one website. You will find the *Website* field in the eCommerce tab of the product edit form. Empty means available in all websites. Products available on some websites \u00b6 To make a product available on some websites, but not all of them, you should duplicate the product for each website. If you need a unique reference to manage in your inventory, you should install Manufacturing and create *Kits BoMs (bills of materials). Each kit will link each published \u201cvirtual\u201d product to the main reference managed in your inventory. That way, any item sold from your website will be converted into the storable item in the delivery order. Pricelists \u00b6 To manage specific prices by websites, you can activate Multiple Sales Prices per Product in Website settings. Then, go to :menuselection: Website --> Products --> Pricelists to create additional pricelists. You can also choose to have a pricelist available only on a specific website. Leaving the field empty means that you make it work in all websites if Selectable is selected. Otherwise, it makes it only available for backend operations of Sales and Point of Sale applications. Payment Providers and Delivery Methods \u00b6 By default, published payment providers and delivery methods are deployed in all websites. You could already use specific payment providers per country using Geo IP by defining countries in their configuration. Now you can also do it per website by filling in the Website field. Customer accounts \u00b6 There is a setting to choose how to manage customer accounts in Website settings. You can either allow customers to use one account through all the websites or compel them to create one account for each website. This last option is convenient if your websites shouldn\u2019t be related to each other in the visitor mind. Technical hints for customization \u00b6 If you want to publish custom objects on the website, here are a few tips to make it work with multi websites: Sitemap: don\u2019t forget the domain in the route to only publish available records in each website\u2019s sitemap. Access: you should call the method can_access_from_current_website in the controller to make sure the visitor can see a record in the current website. Search: when a list of records is displayed, don\u2019t forget to specify the domain to only display records available for the current website.","title":"Manage Multiple Websites"},{"location":"01_application_guide/50_website/01_getting_started/03_optimize/#manage-multi-websites","text":"PerfectWORK\u2019s Multi-Websites opens up broad possibilities of diversification and customer segmentation for your business.

Tracking a product at each stage of stock movement is necessary to bring all operations under control. In order to ensure effective monitoring of the stock movement, lots and serial numbers play an important role. From manufacturing processes to delivery operations, product traceability will keep a proper track that improves the efficiency of stock management. Proper monitoring is required to reduce the risk factors during the stock movements of any company. The PerfectWORK ERP system will record exact details of the stock movement of each component of a product in inventory in the form of a traceability report. The user can observe the whole production to distribution procedures in the inventory using the lots and serial numbers. Lots and serial numbers are not exactly the same. Commonly we use a lot as a unique identification number to identify a group of products of the same type. If the products are small or can not count as individual products, you can put them together in a single pack and allot a lot number. They are picked as batches in the inventory. For individual products, you can assign serial numbers. The serial number is considered to identify individual products in the inventory. We allocate lots and serial numbers for products at the time of their inventory management. You can assign lots and serial numbers to the products while configuring them in the Inventory module so that you can easily keep the traceability report of the respective products thereafter.

It is the track or path of operations used for inventory movements. Without a proper strategy, it is difficult to monitor and manage the inventory movements in a company. Based on your company policies, you can set certain rules of operation to define the product movements in inventory. Using these rules, Odoo will allow you to configure different routes of operations for the products. This will ensure proper inventory management within your company. In the Odoo 16 Inventory module, the users will get separate platforms to define suitable rules and routes for the stock movements. The routes in Odoo work associated with the respective storage locations and warehouse operations so make sure to configure both these options before defining routes for inventory. To set up new routes in Odoo, you are requested to enable this feature from the Settings menu of the module. You can find the Warehouse tab as shown below, from where you can activate the Multi-Step Routes. While activating this option, the Storage Location feature will be automatically activated since they are interlinked. We already discussed how to configure warehouses and locations for inventory management. Now, let\u2019s look at the configuration of rules for the product movement in a company. Creating Rules \u00b6 The user can find the option to configure new rules for the inventory movements from the Configuration menu of the Inventory module. Clicking on the Rules option from the Warehouse Management tab opens a new window with the list view of the already configured Rules as shown below. From this preview, you will get the Action, Source Location, Destination Location, Route, and Company details of each Rule. Just like in any other platform, Odoo makes sure of the availability of the default and customizable Filters and GroupBy options to simplify the searching operations. Without any delay, you can click the Create button to know the steps of the configuration of the new rule in Odoo. In the Name field, you can mention a proper title for the new rule. The next step is to define the Action for the new rule. You will get a drop-down menu here to select the suitable action. \u25cf Pull From: You can set this action when products are needed in the destination location. It can be either from a sales order or a manufacturing order. When the demand for a product happens in the destination location, Odoo will generate a picking operation type from the source location to complete the requirement. \u25cf Push To: You can use this rule to move a product to another location. When products arrive in the source location, you can move them to another location using this action. In this case, Odoo will generate a picking operation type to send them to the destination location. \u25cf Push & Pull: This action can be used in both cases explained above. When products are needed in the destination location a picking is generated from the source location to fulfill the need. This demands product requirements in the source location. Once the source location is fulfilled with the requirement, the products will be pushed to the destination location to fulfill the needs of the destination location. \u25cf Manufacture: Using this action, you can directly generate manufacturing orders to complete the requirements of the source location. \u25cf Buy: When products are needed at the destination location, Odoo will generate a request for quotation to buy the product to fulfill the need with the help of this action. In the next fields, you can mention the Operation Type, Source Location, and Destination Location respectively. In the Applicability tab, you can specify the Route, Warehouse, Company, and Sequence on which this rule is applicable. Under the Propagation tab, you can set the Propagation of Procurement Group as Empty, Fixed, or Propagate. By enabling the Cancel Next Move, the move created by this rule is canceled and the next move will be canceled too. Activating the Propagation of Carrier will propagate the carrier of shipment. In the Warehouse to Propagate field, you can specify the warehouse to propagate on the created move/procurement which can be different from the warehouse this rule is for. Now, let\u2019s check how to configure routes using these rules in the Odoo Inventory. Creating Routes \u00b6 The Warehouse Management tools available in the Configuration menu of the Inventory module will give access to the platform to manage and create various routes of operation. The user can observe the preconfigured list of routes here with the details of the name of the routes and the company. Click the Create button to create a new route for inventory movements. The name of the route can be defined in the Route field. Additionally, you can specify the Sequence, Supplied Warehouse, and Company in the respective fields. You can leave the Company field empty if this route is shared between all companies configured in your database. In the Applicable On tab, you can select the places where this route can be selected. Here, you will get the Product Categories, Products, Packaging, Warehouse, and Sales Order Lines to select based on your company policies. Under the Rules tab, you can specify the rules used for this route of operation with the help of the Add a Line button. You can configure new rules for this route by following the steps we discussed in the earlier section. Finally, don\u2019t forget to click the Save button to save the changes. In Odoo, you can define a specific route of operation for each product while configuring them in the database. In the products management window, you can find a dedicated field under the Inventory tab as shown below exclusively to select the suitable route for the inventory movement of a product. Depending on the module you installed in your Odoo database, this field will allow you to set the route of a product. It can be bought, manufactured, replenished on order, etc, based on the route you select.

From this preview, you will get the Action, Source Location, Destination Location, Route, and Company details of each Rule. Just like in any other platform, Odoo makes sure of the availability of the default and customizable Filters and GroupBy options to simplify the searching operations. Without any delay, you can click the Create button to know the steps of the configuration of the new rule in Odoo. In the Name field, you can mention a proper title for the new rule. The next step is to define the Action for the new rule. You will get a drop-down menu here to select the suitable action. \u25cf Pull From: You can set this action when products are needed in the destination location. It can be either from a sales order or a manufacturing order. When the demand for a product happens in the destination location, Odoo will generate a picking operation type from the source location to complete the requirement. \u25cf Push To: You can use this rule to move a product to another location. When products arrive in the source location, you can move them to another location using this action. In this case, Odoo will generate a picking operation type to send them to the destination location. \u25cf Push & Pull: This action can be used in both cases explained above. When products are needed in the destination location a picking is generated from the source location to fulfill the need. This demands product requirements in the source location. Once the source location is fulfilled with the requirement, the products will be pushed to the destination location to fulfill the needs of the destination location. \u25cf Manufacture: Using this action, you can directly generate manufacturing orders to complete the requirements of the source location. \u25cf Buy: When products are needed at the destination location, Odoo will generate a request for quotation to buy the product to fulfill the need with the help of this action. In the next fields, you can mention the Operation Type, Source Location, and Destination Location respectively. In the Applicability tab, you can specify the Route, Warehouse, Company, and Sequence on which this rule is applicable. Under the Propagation tab, you can set the Propagation of Procurement Group as Empty, Fixed, or Propagate. By enabling the Cancel Next Move, the move created by this rule is canceled and the next move will be canceled too. Activating the Propagation of Carrier will propagate the carrier of shipment. In the Warehouse to Propagate field, you can specify the warehouse to propagate on the created move/procurement which can be different from the warehouse this rule is for. Now, let\u2019s check how to configure routes using these rules in the Odoo Inventory.","title":"Creating Rules"},{"location":"01_application_guide/60_inventory_manufacturing/01_warehouse_management/02_warehouses/03_rules_routes/#creating-routes","text":"The Warehouse Management tools available in the Configuration menu of the Inventory module will give access to the platform to manage and create various routes of operation.

This is how we define routes for product movement in Odoo Inventory.","title":"Creating Routes"},{"location":"01_application_guide/60_inventory_manufacturing/02_inventory_operations/","text":"Odoo Inventory module is the best option for the effective management of all types of inventory operations. Providing proper support for inventory management in a company is essential to run the business flawlessly. When we talk about Odoo as the perfect solution for inventory management, you will be inquisitive about the features it offers. In this section, we will detail the inventory operations managed by Odoo with the dedicated Inventory module. The Overview window of the Inventory module itself will give a clear insight into all possible operations managed by the module. From the Kanban view of the Inventory Overview window, you will be able to manage the Receipt, Internal Transfers, Delivery Orders, Returns, Manufacturing, Resupply Subcontractor, POS Orders, Dropship, Dropship Subcontractor, and many more based on the operations configured in the module. You will get exclusive options in the menu bar of the Inventory module to manage all these operations separately. But, this platform will help you to get an overview of all operations at a glance. The three vertical dots given on the top right corner of each operation tab will give you additional tools to manage each of these operations. If the database is working in a multi-company environment, then the overview will include the inventory operations of all companies configured in your system. Creating new operation types \u00b6 In the Odoo 16 Inventory module, you can effortlessly create new operation types with the help of the dedicated tools introduced in the module. The Operation Types menu can be accessed from the Configuration menu as shown below. Clicking on this option opens a new window with the details of the already configured operation types. You can make changes to the available operation types by selecting them from the given list. Here, we are going to create a new Operation Type. So, click on the Create button. Here, you will get a new window to create a new operation type. You can mention the Operation Type in the corresponding field. Mention the Reference Sequence, Code, Barcode, Reservation Method, and Company in the respective fields. The Reservation Method will decide how the products in transfers of this operation type should be preserved. It can be either at confirmation, manually, or before the scheduled date. When validating a transfer, you can ask your users to choose if they want to create a backorder for the remaining products by selecting the option Ask in the Create Backorder field. By selecting the Always option, Odoo will automatically create a backorder for the remaining products. Selecting the Never option will cancel the remaining products. If you want to show a detailed stock operation in the picking lines then you can check the Show Detailed Operation box. The Default Source Location and Default Destination Location of the transfers of this operation type can be specified in the corresponding fields under the Locations tab. The Type of Operation can be Receipt, Delivery, Manufacturing, or Internal Transfer. Based on the Type of Operation you select, there will be small changes in the remaining fields. Each Type of Operation has different configuration options. For example, if you select Receipt as the Type of Operation the additional fields that appear on the screen are highlighted below. Here, in the case of Receipt, you can activate the Show Reception Report at Validation feature if you want to get an automated reception report at the time of validation. In the Operation Type for Returns field, you can specify the operation type suitable for the return operations of the products. Odoo will automatically pre-fill the detailed operations with the corresponding products, location, and lot/serial numbers. By activating the Create New Lots/Serial Numbers option from the Traceability tab, Odoo will allow you to create new lots/serial numbers for the products in the transfers of this operation type. You can also use the existing lots/serial numbers for product transfers by activating the Use Existing Lots/Serial Numbers option. By checking the Move Entire Packages box from the Packages tab, you will be able to select entire packages to move. The Product traceability feature offered by Odoo will assist in tracing and tracking each and every component of a product. Tracking a product at each stage of stock movement is necessary to bring all operations under control. In order to ensure effective monitoring of the stock movement, lots and serial numbers play an important role. From manufacturing processes to delivery operations, product traceability will keep a proper track that improves the efficiency of stock management. Proper monitoring is required to reduce the risk factors during the stock movements of any company. The Odoo ERP system will record exact details of the stock movement of each component of a product in inventory in the form of a traceability report. The user can observe the whole production to distribution procedures in the inventory using the lots and serial numbers. Lots and serial numbers are not exactly the same. Commonly we use a lot as a unique identification number to identify a group of products of the same type. If the products are small or can not count as individual products, you can put them together in a single pack and allot a lot number. They are picked as batches in the inventory. For individual products, you can assign serial numbers. The serial number is considered to identify individual products in the inventory. We allocate lots and serial numbers for products at the time of their inventory management. You can assign lots and serial numbers to the products while configuring them in the Inventory module so that you can easily keep the traceability report of the respective products thereafter. The inventory management tools offered by Odoo 16 support this traceability feature to ensure effective tracking operations. In order to get the complete features of the traceability in the Inventory module, you are requested to activate the Lots & Serial Numbers option from the Settings menu. As shown in the image above, this feature will be available under the Traceability tab. After activating this feature, you will get the Lots/Serial Numbers option under the Products menu.

By using this method, you can minimize the difficulties faced while managing bulk transfers. The Batch Transfer feature can be easily activated from the Settings menu of the Inventory module as depicted in the image below. After selecting the Batch Transfer option click the Save button to save the new changes. Now, you can manage batch transfers from the platform available under the Operations menu as shown below. The list of already created batches along with the details of the Batch Transfer, Scheduled Date, Responsible, Operation Type, Company, and State can be seen here. You can alter the view of the platform into Kanban also. To create a new batch transfer, you can use the Create button. You can assign an employee in the Responsible field who will be incharge of the upcoming activities of this batch transfer. Specify the Operation Type and Company in the given spaces. By mentioning the Operation Type, Odoo lets you add transfers with this operation type to this batch. The expected date for the transfer can be scheduled manually in the Scheduled Date field. If it is not manually set, Odoo will consider the earliest scheduled date of the transfer included in the batch as the scheduled date for this transfer. Now, you can add transfers one by one to this batch using the Add a Line button available in the Transfer tab. As soon as you click the Add a Line button, a new pop will appear to select the transfers for this batch. You will get a list of various transfers of the selected operation type in different stages. You can select the transfers from the given list. Make sure to select the transfers from the same stage. In order to add them to the batch, you can use the Select button. As you can see in the image above, the list of selected transfers will be automatically added to the batch. If you want to remove any of the transfers from the batch, you can use the \u274c icon highlighted in the screenshot above. After checking availability, you can confirm the transfer using the Confirm button. Finally, clicking on the Validate button you can complete the batch transfer operation.You can create new batch transfers from the Transfers menu also. For this, you can go to the Transfers platform available under the Operations menu. From the available list of transfers, you can select the transfers that you want to add to a batch. Don\u2019t forget that the selected transfers should be in the same status and operation type. After selecting required transfers, you will get an Action button. From the Action button, you will get the option to add the selected transfers to a batch. Click on the Add to Batch button. A pop will appear as shown below. You can add the selected transfers to an existing batch transfer or to a new batch transfer. For new batch transfer, you can mention the Responsible employee in the given field. If you want to create the new batch in draft status, activate the Draft option. Clicking on the Confirm button will create a new batch transfer in the Inventory module. You can observe and manage the new batch transfer from the Batch Transfer platform.","title":"Batch Transfer"},{"location":"01_application_guide/60_inventory_manufacturing/02_inventory_operations/02_product_variants/#wave-transfer","text":"The Wave Transfer method is also used for the same purpose of the Batch Transfer option. Using this method, you can move a large number of products from one location to another. But, once you add a transfer into a wave transfer you can not remove it from the wave.

Once the Wave Transfer feature is activated, you can go to the Transfers platform. From the Transfers window, you can select the transfers belonging to the same status and operation type to add them to a wave transfer.

The signature of the methods mimics the standard methods provided by the osv.Model PerfectWORK class. This is intended to help the developer when developping addons. What is experimented at the interactive prompt should be portable in the application with little effort. Client and Services \u00b6 The Client object provides thin wrappers around PerfectWORK RPC services and their methods. Additional helpers are provided to explore the models and list or install PerfectWORK add-ons. class pw_cli . Client ( server , db = None , user = None , password = None , transport = None , verbose = False ) Connection to an PerfectWORK instance. This is the top level object. The server is the URL of the instance, like http://localhost:8069 . If server is an PerfectWORK/openerp Python package, it is used to connect to the local server. The db is the name of the database and the user should exist in the table res.users. If the password is not provided, it will be asked on login. class methodClient . from_config ( environment , user = None , verbose = False )[ source ] Create a connection to a defined environment. Read the settings from the section [environment] in the pw_cli.ini file and return a connected Client. See read_config() for details of the configuration file format. Client . create_database ( passwd , database , demo = False , lang = 'en_US' , user_password = 'admin' , login = 'admin' , country_code = None )[ source ] Create a new database. The superadmin passwd and the database name are mandatory. By default, demo data are not loaded, lang is en_US and no country is set into the database. Login if successful. Client . clone_database ( passwd , database )[ source ] Clone the current database. The superadmin passwd and database are mandatory. Login if successful. Client . login ( user , password = None , database = None )[ source ] Switch user and (optionally) database. Note In interactive mode, a method Client.connect(env=None) exists, to connect to another environment, and recreate the globals(). PerfectWORK RPC Services \u00b6 The naked PerfectWORK RPC services are exposed too. The db and the common services expose few methods which might be helpful for server administration. Use the dir() function to introspect them. The _object service should not be used directly because its methods are wrapped and exposed on the Env object itself. The two last services are deprecated and removed in recent versions of PerfectWORK. Please refer to the PerfectWORK documentation for more details. Client . db Expose the db Service. Examples: Client.db.list() or Client.db.server_version() RPC methods. Client . common Expose the common Service. Example: Client.common.login_message() RPC method. Client . _object Expose the object Service. Client . _report Expose the report Service. class pw_cli . Service ( client , endpoint , methods , verbose = False )[ source ] A wrapper around XML-RPC endpoints. The connected endpoints are exposed on the Client instance. The server argument is the URL of the server (scheme+host+port). If server is an PerfectWORK Python package, it is used to connect to the local server. The endpoint argument is the name of the service (examples: \"object\", \"db\"). The methods is the list of methods which should be exposed on this endpoint. Use dir(...) on the instance to list them. Environment \u00b6 class PerfectWORKly . Env [ source ] An environment wraps data for PerfectWORK models and records: db_name, the current database; uid, the current user id; context, the current context dictionary. To retrieve an instance of some.model: >>> env [ \"some.model\" ] db_name \u00b6 Environment\u2019s database name. uid \u00b6 Environment\u2019s user id. user \u00b6 Instance of the environment\u2019s user. context \u00b6 Environment\u2019s context dictionary. It defaults to the lang and tz of the user. Use Model.with_context() to switch the context. For example env['account.invoice'].with_context({}) can be used to call a method which does not accept the context argument. cr \u00b6 Cursor on the current database. sudo(user=SUPERUSER_ID)[source] \u00b6 Attach to the provided user, or SUPERUSER. getitem (name)[source] \u00b6 Return the given Model. access(model_name, mode='read')[source] \u00b6 Check if the user has access to this model. Optional argument mode is the access mode to check. Valid values are read, write, create and unlink. If omitted, the read mode is checked. Return a boolean. execute(obj, method, *params, **kwargs)[source] \u00b6 Wrapper around object.execute_kw RPC method. Argument method is the name of an osv.osv method or a method available on this obj. Method params are allowed. If needed, keyword arguments are collected in kwargs. lang \u00b6 Return the current language code. models(name='')[source] \u00b6 Search PerfectWORK models. The argument name is a pattern to filter the models returned. If omitted, all models are returned. The return value is a sorted list of model names. PerfectWORK_env \u00b6 Return a server Environment. Supported since PerfectWORK 8. ref(xml_id)[source] \u00b6 Return the record for the given xml_id external ID. registry \u00b6 Return the environment\u2019s registry. Note When connected to the local PerfectWORK server, the Env.PerfectWORK_env attribute grabs an PerfectWORK Environment with the same characteristics as the Env instance (db_name, uid, context). In this case a cursor on the database is available as Env.cr. Advanced methods \u00b6 Those methods give more control on the PerfectWORK objects: workflows and reports. Please refer to the PerfectWORK documentation for details. Env . execute ( obj , method , * params , ** kwargs )[ source ] Wrapper around object.execute_kw RPC method. Argument method is the name of an osv.osv method or a method available on this obj. Method params are allowed. If needed, keyword arguments are collected in kwargs. Manage addons \u00b6 These helpers are convenient to list, install or upgrade addons from a Python script or interactively in a Python session. Env . modules ( name = '' , installed = None )[ source ] Return a dictionary of modules. The optional argument name is a pattern to filter the modules. If the boolean argument installed is True, the modules which are \u201cNot Installed\u201d or \u201cNot Installable\u201d are omitted. If the argument is False, only these modules are returned. If argument installed is omitted, all modules are returned. The return value is a dictionary where module names are grouped in lists according to their state. Env . install ( * modules )[ source ] Press the button Install. Env . upgrade ( * modules )[ source ] Press the button Upgrade. Env . uninstall ( * modules )[ source ] Press the button Uninstall. Note It is not recommended to install or upgrade modules in offline mode when any web server is still running: the operation will not be signaled to other processes. This restriction does not apply when connected through XML-RPC or JSON-RPC. Model and Records \u00b6 The Env provides a high level API similar to the PerfectWORK API, which encapsulates objects into Active Records. The Model is instantiated using the client.env[...] syntax. Example: client.env['res.company'] returns a Model. class pw_cli . Model ( client , model_name )[ source ] The class for PerfectWORK models. keys()[source] Return the keys of the model. fields(names=None, attributes=None)[source] Return a dictionary of the fields of the model. Optional argument names is a sequence of field names or a space separated string of these names. If omitted, all fields are returned. Optional argument attributes is a sequence of attributes or a space separated string of these attributes. If omitted, all attributes are returned. field(name)[source] Return the field properties for field name. access(mode='read')[source] Check if the user has access to this model. Optional argument mode is the access mode to check. Valid values are read, write, create and unlink. If omitted, the read mode is checked. Return a boolean. search(domain, offset=0, limit=None, order=None)[source] Search for records in the domain. search_count(domain)[source] Count the records in the domain. read(domain, fields=None, offset=0, limit=None, order=None)[source] Wrapper for client.execute(model, 'read', [...], ('a', 'b')).

The second argument, fields, accepts: - a single field: 'first_name' - a tuple of fields: ('street', 'city') - a space separated string: 'street city' - a format spec: '%(street)s %(city)s' If fields is omitted, all fields are read. If domain is a single id, then: return a single value if a single field is requested. return a string if a format spec is passed in the fields argument. else, return a dictionary. If domain is not a single id, the returned value is a list of items. Each item complies with the rules of the previous paragraph. The optional keyword arguments offset, limit and order are used to restrict the search. The order is also used to order the results returned. Note: the low-level RPC method read itself does not preserve the order of the results. get(domain)[source] Return a single Record. The argument domain accepts a single integer id or a search domain, or an external ID xml_id. The return value is a Record or None. If multiple records are found, a ValueError is raised. browse(ids)[source] Return a Record or a RecordList. The argument ids accepts a single integer id or a list of ids. If it is a single integer, the return value is a Record. Otherwise, the return value is a RecordList. create(values)[source] Create a Record. The argument values is a dictionary of values which are used to create the record. Relationship fields one2many and many2many accept either a list of ids or a RecordList or the extended PerfectWORK syntax. Relationship fields many2one and reference accept either a Record or the PerfectWORK syntax. The newly created Record is returned. with_env(env) Attach to the provided environment. sudo(user=SUPERUSER_ID) Attach to the provided user, or SUPERUSER. with_context([context][, **overrides]) Attach to an extended context. _get_external_ids(ids=None)[source] Retrieve the External IDs of the records. Return a dictionary with keys being the fully qualified External IDs, and values the Record entries. class pw_cli . RecordList ( model , ids )[ source ] A sequence of PerfectWORK Record. It has a similar API as the Record class, but for a list of records. The attributes of the RecordList are read-only, and they return list of attribute values in the same order. The many2one, one2many and many2many attributes are wrapped in RecordList and list of RecordList objects. Use the method RecordList.write to assign a single value to all the selected records. read(fields=None)[source] Wrapper for the Record.read() method. Return a RecordList if fields is the name of a single many2one field, else return a list. See Model.read() for details. write(values) Wrapper for the Record.write() method. unlink() Wrapper for the Record.unlink() method. exists() Return a subset of records that exist. mapped(func) Apply func on all records. filtered(func) Select the records such that func(rec) is true. As an alternative func can be a search domain (list) to search among the records. sorted(key=None, reverse=False) Return the records sorted by key. ensure_one() Return the single record in this recordset. Raise a ValueError it recordset has more records or is empty. union(*args) Return the union of all records. Preserve first occurence order. concat(*args) Return the concatenation of all records. with_env(env) Attach to the provided environment. sudo(user=SUPERUSER_ID) Attach to the provided user, or SUPERUSER. with_context([context][, **overrides]) Attach to an extended context. get_metadata() Wrapper for the Record.get_metadata() method. _external_id Retrieve the External IDs of the RecordList. Return the list of fully qualified External IDs of the RecordList, with default value False if there\u2019s none. If multiple IDs exist for a record, only one of them is returned. class pw_cli . Record ( model , id )[ source ] A class for all PerfectWORK records. It maps any PerfectWORK object. The fields can be accessed through attributes. The changes are immediately sent to the server. The many2one, one2many and many2many attributes are wrapped in Record and RecordList objects. These attributes support writing too. The attributes are evaluated lazily, and they are cached in the record. The Record\u2019s cache is invalidated if any attribute is changed. exists() Return a subset of records that exist. get_metadata(details=True) Lookup metadata about the record(s). Return dictionaries with the following keys: id: object id create_uid: user who created the record create_date: date when the record was created write_uid: last user who changed the record write_date: date of the last change to the record xmlid: External ID to use to refer to this record (if there is one), in format module.name. _external_id Retrieve the External ID of the Record. Return the fully qualified External ID of the Record, with default value False if there\u2019s none. If multiple IDs exist, only one of them is returned (randomly). _send(signal)[source] Trigger workflow signal for this Record. copy(default=None)[source] Copy a record and return the new Record. The optional argument default is a mapping which overrides some values of the new record. read(fields=None)[source] Read the fields of the Record. The argument fields accepts different kinds of values. See Model.read() for details. refresh()[source] Force refreshing the record\u2019s data. unlink() Delete the record(s) from the database. write(values) Write the values in the record(s). values is a dictionary of values. See Model.create() for details. Utilities \u00b6 pw_cli . issearchdomain ( arg )[ source ] Check if the argument is a search domain. Examples: [('name', '=', 'mushroom'), ('state', '!=', 'draft')] ['name = mushroom', 'state != draft'] [] pw_cli . searchargs ( params , kwargs = None )[ source ] Compute the \u2018search\u2019 parameters. pw_cli . format_exception ( type , value , tb , limit = None , chain = True )[ source ] Format a stack trace and the exception information. This wrapper is a replacement of traceback.format_exception which formats the error and traceback received by XML-RPC/JSON-RPC. If chain is True, then the original exception is printed too. pw_cli . read_config ( section = None )[ source ] Read the environment settings from the configuration file. The config file PerfectWORKly.ini contains a section for each environment. Each section provides parameters for the connection: host, port, database, username and (optional) password. Default values are read from the [DEFAULT] section. If the password is not in the configuration file, it is requested on login. Return a tuple (server, db, user, password or None). Without argument, it returns the list of configured environments. pw_cli.start_PerfectWORK_services(options=None, appname=None)[source] Initialize the PerfectWORK services. Import the PerfectWORK Python package and load the PerfectWORK services. The argument options receives the command line arguments for PerfectWORK. Example: ['-c', '/path/to/PerfectWORK-server.conf', '--without-demo', 'all']. Return the PW CLI package.","title":"API"},{"location":"04_developer_guide/01_pw_cli/01_api/#client-and-services","text":"The Client object provides thin wrappers around PerfectWORK RPC services and their methods.

Part of the Models API is easily available over XML-RPC and accessible from a variety of languages. Connection \u00b6 Configuration \u00b6 If you already have an PerfectWORK server installed, you can just use its parameters Info To make exploration simpler, you can also ask https://demo.perfectwork.app for a test database. Python Ruby PHP Java import xmlrpc.client info = xmlrpc . client . ServerProxy ( 'https://demo.perfectwork.app/start' ) . start () url , db , username , password = info [ 'host' ], info [ 'database' ], info [ 'user' ], info [ 'password' ] require \"xmlrpc/client\" info = XMLRPC :: Client . new2 ( 'https://demo.perfectwork.app/start' ) . call ( 'start' ) url , db , username , password = info [ 'host' ] , info [ 'database' ] , info [ 'user' ] , info [ 'password' ] require_once('ripcord.php'); $info = ripcord::client('https://demo.perfectwork.app/start')->start(); list($url, $db, $username, $password) = array($info['host'], $info['database'], $info['user'], $info['password']); final XmlRpcClient client = new XmlRpcClient (); final XmlRpcClientConfigImpl start_config = new XmlRpcClientConfigImpl (); start_config . setServerURL ( new URL ( \"https://demo.perfectwork.app/start\" )); final Map < String , String > info = ( Map < String , String > ) client . execute ( start_config , \"start\" , emptyList ()); final String url = info . get ( \"host\" ), db = info . get ( \"database\" ), username = info . get ( \"user\" ), password = info . get ( \"password\" ); Note These examples use the Apache XML-RPC library. The examples do not include imports as these imports couldn\u2019t be pasted in the code. Logging in \u00b6 PerfectWORK requires users of the API to be authenticated before they can query most data. The xmlrpc/2/common endpoint provides meta-calls which don\u2019t require authentication, such as the authentication itself or fetching version information. To verify if the connection information is correct before trying to authenticate, the simplest call is to ask for the server\u2019s version. The authentication itself is done through the authenticate function and returns a user identifier ( uid ) used in authenticated calls instead of the login. Python Ruby PHP Java common = xmlrpc . client . ServerProxy ( ' {} /xmlrpc/2/common' . format ( url )) common . version () common = XMLRPC :: Client . new2 ( \" #{ url } /xmlrpc/2/common\" ) common . call ( 'version' ) $common = ripcord::client(\"$url/xmlrpc/2/common\"); $common->version(); final XmlRpcClientConfigImpl common_config = new XmlRpcClientConfigImpl (); common_config . setServerURL ( new URL ( String . format ( \"%s/xmlrpc/2/common\" , url ))); client . execute ( common_config , \"version\" , emptyList ()); Result : { \"server_version\": \"13.0\", \"server_version_info\": [13, 0, 0, \"final\", 0], \"server_serie\": \"13.0\", \"protocol_version\": 1, } ` Python Ruby PHP Java uid = common . authenticate ( db , username , password , {}) uid = common . call ( 'authenticate' , db , username , password , {}) $uid = $common->authenticate($db, $username, $password, array()); int uid = ( int ) client . execute ( common_config , \"authenticate\" , asList ( db , username , password , emptyMap ())); Calling Methods \u00b6 The second endpoint is xmlrpc/2/object . It is used to call methods of PerfectWORK data models via the execute_kw RPC function. Each call to execute_kw takes the following parameters: the database to use, a string the user id (retrieved through authenticate ), an integer the user\u2019s password, a string the model name, a string the method name, a string an array/list of parameters passed by position a mapping/dict of parameters to pass by keyword (optional) Example For instance, to see if we can read the res.partner model, we can call check_access_rights with operation passed by position and raise_exception passed by keyword (in order to get a true/false result rather than true/error): Python Ruby PHP Java models = xmlrpc . client . ServerProxy ( ' {} /xmlrpc/2/object' . format ( url )) models . execute_kw ( db , uid , password , 'res.partner' , 'check_access_rights' , [ 'read' ], { 'raise_exception' : False }) models = XMLRPC :: Client . new2 ( \" #{ url } /xmlrpc/2/object\" ) . proxy models . execute_kw ( db , uid , password , 'res.partner' , 'check_access_rights' , [ 'read' ] , { raise_exception : false }) $models = ripcord::client(\"$url/xmlrpc/2/object\"); $models->execute_kw($db, $uid, $password, 'res.partner', 'check_access_rights', array('read'), array('raise_exception' => false)); final XmlRpcClient models = new XmlRpcClient () { setConfig ( new XmlRpcClientConfigImpl () { setServerURL ( new URL ( String . format ( \"%s/xmlrpc/2/object\" , url ))); }); }; models . execute ( \"execute_kw\" , asList ( db , uid , password , \"res.partner\" , \"check_access_rights\" , asList ( \"read\" ), new HashMap () { put ( \"raise_exception\" , false ); } )); Result : true List Records \u00b6 Records can be listed and filtered via search() . search() takes a mandatory domain filter (possibly empty), and returns the database identifiers of all records matching the filter. Example To list customer companies, for instance: Python Ruby PHP Java models . execute_kw ( db , uid , password , 'res.partner' , 'search' , [[[ 'is_company' , '=' , True ]]]) models . execute_kw ( db , uid , password , 'res.partner' , 'search' , [[[ 'is_company' , '=' , true ]]] ) $models->execute_kw($db, $uid, $password, 'res.partner', 'search', array(array(array('is_company', '=', true)))); asList (( Object [] ) models . execute ( \"execute_kw\" , asList ( db , uid , password , \"res.partner\" , \"search\" , asList ( asList ( asList ( \"is_company\" , \"=\" , true ))) ))); Result : [7, 18, 12, 14, 17, 19, 8, 31, 26, 16, 13, 20, 30, 22, 29, 15, 23, 28, 74] Pagination \u00b6 By default a search will return the ids of all records matching the condition, which may be a huge number. offset and limit parameters are available to only retrieve a subset of all matched records. Example To list customer companies, for instance: Python Ruby PHP Java models . execute_kw ( db , uid , password , 'res.partner' , 'search' , [[[ 'is_company' , '=' , True ]]], { 'offset' : 10 , 'limit' : 5 }) models . execute_kw ( db , uid , password , 'res.partner' , 'search' , [[[ 'is_company' , '=' , true ]]] , { offset : 10 , limit : 5 }) $models->execute_kw($db, $uid, $password, 'res.partner', 'search', array(array(array('is_company', '=', true))), array('offset'=>10, 'limit'=>5)); asList (( Object [] ) models . execute ( \"execute_kw\" , asList ( db , uid , password , \"res.partner\" , \"search\" , asList ( asList ( asList ( \"is_company\" , \"=\" , true ))), new HashMap () { put ( \"offset\" , 10 ); put ( \"limit\" , 5 ); } ))); Result: [ 13 , 20 , 30 , 22 , 29 ] Count records \u00b6 Rather than retrieve a possibly gigantic list of records and count them, search_count() can be used to retrieve only the number of records matching the query. It takes the same domain filter as search() and no other parameter. Example To list customer companies, for instance: Python Ruby PHP Java models . execute_kw ( db , uid , password , 'res.partner' , 'search_count' , [[[ 'is_company' , '=' , True ]]]) models . execute_kw ( db , uid , password , 'res.partner' , 'search_count' , [[[ 'is_company' , '=' , true ]]] ) $models->execute_kw($db, $uid, $password, 'res.partner', 'search_count', array(array(array('is_company', '=', true)))); ( Integer ) models . execute ( \"execute_kw\" , asList ( db , uid , password , \"res.partner\" , \"search_count\" , asList ( asList ( asList ( \"is_company\" , \"=\" , true ))) )); Result: 19 Note Calling search then search_count (or the other way around) may not yield coherent results if other users are using the server: stored data could have changed between the calls. Read records \u00b6 Record data are accessible via the read() method, which takes a list of ids (as returned by search() ), and optionally a list of fields to fetch. By default, it fetches all the fields the current user can read, which tends to be a huge amount. Example Python Ruby PHP Java ids = models . execute_kw ( db , uid , password , 'res.partner' , 'search' , [[[ 'is_company' , '=' , True ]]], { 'limit' : 1 }) [ record ] = models . execute_kw ( db , uid , password , 'res.partner' , 'read' , [ ids ]) # count the number of fields fetched by default len ( record ) ids = models . execute_kw ( db , uid , password , 'res.partner' , 'search' , [[[ 'is_company' , '=' , true ]]] , { limit : 1 }) record = models . execute_kw ( db , uid , password , 'res.partner' , 'read' , [ ids ] ) . first # count the number of fields fetched by default record . length $ids = $models->execute_kw($db, $uid, $password, 'res.partner', 'search', array(array(array('is_company', '=', true))), array('limit'=>1)); $records = $models->execute_kw($db, $uid, $password, 'res.partner', 'read', array($ids)); // count the number of fields fetched by default count($records[0]); final List ids = asList (( Object [] ) models . execute ( \"execute_kw\" , asList ( db , uid , password , \"res.partner\" , \"search\" , asList ( asList ( asList ( \"is_company\" , \"=\" , true ))), new HashMap () { put ( \"limit\" , 1 ); }))); final Map record = ( Map )(( Object [] ) models . execute ( \"execute_kw\" , asList ( db , uid , password , \"res.partner\" , \"read\" , asList ( ids ) ) )) [ 0 ] ; // count the number of fields fetched by default record . size (); Result: 121 Conversely, picking only three fields deemed interesting. Python Ruby PHP Java models . execute_kw ( db , uid , password , 'res.partner' , 'read' , [ ids ], { 'fields' : [ 'name' , 'country_id' , 'comment' ]}) models . execute_kw ( db , uid , password , 'res.partner' , 'read' , [ ids ] , { fields : %w(name country_id comment) }) $models->execute_kw($db, $uid, $password, 'res.partner', 'read', array($ids), array('fields'=>array('name', 'country_id', 'comment'))); asList (( Object [] ) models . execute ( \"execute_kw\" , asList ( db , uid , password , \"res.partner\" , \"read\" , asList ( ids ), new HashMap () { put ( \"fields\" , asList ( \"name\" , \"country_id\" , \"comment\" )); } ))); Result: [{ \"comment\" : false , \"country_id\" : [ 21 , \"Belgium\" ], \"id\" : 7 , \"name\" : \"Agrolait\" }] Note Even if the id field is not requested, it is always returned. List record fields \u00b6 fields_get() can be used to inspect a model\u2019s fields and check which ones seem to be of interest. Because it returns a large amount of meta-information (it is also used by client programs) it should be filtered before printing, the most interesting items for a human user are string (the field\u2019s label), help (a help text if available) and type (to know which values to expect, or to send when updating a record). Example Python Ruby PHP Java models . execute_kw ( db , uid , password , 'res.partner' , 'fields_get' , [], { 'attributes' : [ 'string' , 'help' , 'type' ]}) models . execute_kw ( db , uid , password , 'res.partner' , 'fields_get' , [] , { attributes : %w(string help type) }) $models->execute_kw($db, $uid, $password, 'res.partner', 'fields_get', array(), array('attributes' => array('string', 'help', 'type'))); ( Map < String , Map < String , Object >> ) models . execute ( \"execute_kw\" , asList ( db , uid , password , \"res.partner\" , \"fields_get\" , emptyList (), new HashMap () { put ( \"attributes\" , asList ( \"string\" , \"help\" , \"type\" )); } )); Result: { \"ean13\" : { \"type\" : \"char\" , \"help\" : \"BarCode\" , \"string\" : \"EAN13\" }, \"property_account_position_id\" : { \"type\" : \"many2one\" , \"help\" : \"The fiscal position will determine taxes and accounts used for the partner.\" , \"string\" : \"Fiscal Position\" }, \"signup_valid\" : { \"type\" : \"boolean\" , \"help\" : \"\" , \"string\" : \"Signup Token is Valid\" }, \"date_localization\" : { \"type\" : \"date\" , \"help\" : \"\" , \"string\" : \"Geo Localization Date\" }, \"ref_company_ids\" : { \"type\" : \"one2many\" , \"help\" : \"\" , \"string\" : \"Companies that refers to partner\" }, \"sale_order_count\" : { \"type\" : \"integer\" , \"help\" : \"\" , \"string\" : \"# of Sales Order\" }, \"purchase_order_count\" : { \"type\" : \"integer\" , \"help\" : \"\" , \"string\" : \"# of Purchase Order\" }, Search and read \u00b6 Because it is a very common task, PerfectWORK provides a search_read() shortcut which, as its name suggests, is equivalent to a search() followed by a read() , but avoids having to perform two requests and keep ids around. Its arguments are similar to search() \u2019s, but it can also take a list of fields (like read() , if that list is not provided it will fetch all fields of matched records). Example Python Ruby PHP Java ids = models . execute_kw ( db , uid , password , 'res.partner' , 'search' , [[[ 'is_company' , '=' , True ]]], { 'limit' : 1 }) [ record ] = models . execute_kw ( db , uid , password , 'res.partner' , 'read' , [ ids ]) # count the number of fields fetched by default len ( record ) ids = models . execute_kw ( db , uid , password , 'res.partner' , 'search' , [[[ 'is_company' , '=' , true ]]] , { limit : 1 }) record = models . execute_kw ( db , uid , password , 'res.partner' , 'read' , [ ids ] ) . first # count the number of fields fetched by default record . length $ids = $models->execute_kw($db, $uid, $password, 'res.partner', 'search', array(array(array('is_company', '=', true))), array('limit'=>1)); $records = $models->execute_kw($db, $uid, $password, 'res.partner', 'read', array($ids)); // count the number of fields fetched by default count($records[0]); asList (( Object [] ) models . execute ( \"execute_kw\" , asList ( db , uid , password , \"res.partner\" , \"search_read\" , asList ( asList ( asList ( \"is_company\" , \"=\" , true ))), new HashMap () { put ( \"fields\" , asList ( \"name\" , \"country_id\" , \"comment\" )); put ( \"limit\" , 5 ); } ))); Result: 121 Conversely, picking only three fields deemed interesting. Python Ruby PHP Java models . execute_kw ( db , uid , password , 'res.partner' , 'search_read' , [[[ 'is_company' , '=' , True ]]], { 'fields' : [ 'name' , 'country_id' , 'comment' ], 'limit' : 5 }) models . execute_kw ( db , uid , password , 'res.partner' , 'search_read' , [[[ 'is_company' , '=' , true ]]] , { fields : %w(name country_id comment) , limit : 5 }) $models->execute_kw($db, $uid, $password, 'res.partner', 'search_read', array(array(array('is_company', '=', true))), array('fields'=>array('name', 'country_id', 'comment'), 'limit'=>5)); asList (( Object [] ) models . execute ( \"execute_kw\" , asList ( db , uid , password , \"res.partner\" , \"search_read\" , asList ( asList ( asList ( \"is_company\" , \"=\" , true ))), new HashMap () { put ( \"fields\" , asList ( \"name\" , \"country_id\" , \"comment\" )); put ( \"limit\" , 5 ); } ))); Result: [ { \"comment\" : false , \"country_id\" : [ 21 , \"Belgium\" ], \"id\" : 7 , \"name\" : \"Agrolait\" }, { \"comment\" : false , \"country_id\" : [ 76 , \"France\" ], \"id\" : 18 , \"name\" : \"Axelor\" }, { \"comment\" : false , \"country_id\" : [ 233 , \"United Kingdom\" ], \"id\" : 12 , \"name\" : \"Bank Wealthy and sons\" }, { \"comment\" : false , \"country_id\" : [ 105 , \"India\" ], \"id\" : 14 , \"name\" : \"Best Designers\" }, { \"comment\" : false , \"country_id\" : [ 76 , \"France\" ], \"id\" : 17 , \"name\" : \"Camptocamp\" } ] Create records \u00b6 Records of a model are created using create() . The method creates a single record and returns its database identifier. create() takes a mapping of fields to values, used to initialize the record. For any field which has a default value and is not set through the mapping argument, the default value will be used. Example Python Ruby PHP Java id = models . execute_kw ( db , uid , password , 'res.partner' , 'create' , [{ 'name' : \"New Partner\" }]) id = models . execute_kw ( db , uid , password , 'res.partner' , 'create' , [ { name : \"New Partner\" } ] ) $id = $models->execute_kw($db, $uid, $password, 'res.partner', 'create', array(array('name'=>\"New Partner\"))); final Integer id = ( Integer ) models . execute ( \"execute_kw\" , asList ( db , uid , password , \"res.partner\" , \"create\" , asList ( new HashMap () { put ( \"name\" , \"New Partner\" ); }) )); Result: 121 Conversely, picking only three fields deemed interesting.

Update records \u00b6 Records can be updated using write(). It takes a list of records to update and a mapping of updated fields to values similar to create(). Multiple records can be updated simultaneously, but they will all get the same values for the fields being set. It is not possible to perform \u201ccomputed\u201d updates (where the value being set depends on an existing value of a record). Example Python Ruby PHP Java models . execute_kw ( db , uid , password , 'res.partner' , 'write' , [[ id ], { 'name' : \"Newer partner\" }]) # get record name after having changed it models . execute_kw ( db , uid , password , 'res.partner' , 'name_get' , [[ id ]]) models . execute_kw ( db , uid , password , 'res.partner' , 'write' , [[ id ] , { name : \"Newer partner\" } ] ) # get record name after having changed it models . execute_kw ( db , uid , password , 'res.partner' , 'name_get' , [[ id ]] ) $models->execute_kw($db, $uid, $password, 'res.partner', 'write', array(array($id), array('name'=>\"Newer partner\"))); // get record name after having changed it $models->execute_kw($db, $uid, $password,'res.partner', 'name_get', array(array($id))); models . execute ( \"execute_kw\" , asList ( db , uid , password , \"res.partner\" , \"write\" , asList ( asList ( id ), new HashMap () { put ( \"name\" , \"Newer Partner\" ); } ) )); // get record name after having changed it asList (( Object [] ) models . execute ( \"execute_kw\" , asList ( db , uid , password , \"res.partner\" , \"name_get\" , asList ( asList ( id )) ))); Result: [[ 78 , \"Newer partner\" ]] Delete records \u00b6 Records can be deleted in bulk by providing their ids to unlink() . Example Python Ruby PHP Java models . execute_kw ( db , uid , password , 'res.partner' , 'unlink' , [[ id ]]) # check if the deleted record is still in the database models . execute_kw ( db , uid , password , 'res.partner' , 'search' , [[[ 'id' , '=' , id ]]]) models . execute_kw ( db , uid , password , 'res.partner' , 'unlink' , [[ id ]] ) # check if the deleted record is still in the database models . execute_kw ( db , uid , password , 'res.partner' , 'search' , [[[ 'id' , '=' , id ]]] ) $models->execute_kw($db, $uid, $password, 'res.partner', 'unlink', array(array($id))); // check if the deleted record is still in the database $models->execute_kw($db, $uid, $password, 'res.partner', 'search', array(array(array('id', '=', $id)))); models . execute ( \"execute_kw\" , asList ( db , uid , password , \"res.partner\" , \"unlink\" , asList ( asList ( id )))); // check if the deleted record is still in the database asList (( Object [] ) models . execute ( \"execute_kw\" , asList ( db , uid , password , \"res.partner\" , \"search\" , asList ( asList ( asList ( \"id\" , \"=\" , 78 ))) ))); Result: [] Inspection and introspection \u00b6 While we previously used fields_get() to query a model and have been using an arbitrary model from the start, PerfectWORK stores most model metadata inside a few meta-models which allow both querying the system and altering models and fields (with some limitations) on the fly over XML-RPC. ir.model Provides information about PerfectWORK models via its various fields. name a human-readable description of the model model the name of each model in the system state whether the model was generated in Python code (base) or by creating an ir.model record (manual) field_id list of the model\u2019s fields through a One2many to ir.model.fields view_ids One2many to the Views defined for the model access_ids One2many relation to the Access Rights set on the model ir.model can be used to Query the system for installed models (as a precondition to operations on the model or to explore the system\u2019s content). Get information about a specific model (generally by listing the fields associated with it). Create new models dynamically over RPC. Important Custom model names must start with x_.

This project, OpenUpgrade, aims to provide an Open Source upgrade path for Odoo. This is a community initiative, as the open source version of Odoo does not support migrations from one major release to another. Instead, migrations are part of a support package sold by Odoo SA. Note that the name of the project refers to the old name of Odoo, OpenERP. The project is hosted as two separate GitHub projects https://github.com/OCA/openupgrade The branches in the first project contain the framework, as well as the database analysis and the migration scripts. https://github.com/OCA/openupgradelib The second project contains a library with helper functions. It can be used in the migration of any Odoo module. Changes in OpenUpgrade for PW 3.3 Before Odoo 14.0, the branches in https://github.com/OCA/openupgrade contain copies (or forks in Git terminology) of the Odoo main project, but with extra commits that include the framework, and the analysis and the migration scripts for each module. Migrating your database \u00b6 Check out the code manually and upgrade your database by calling odoo-bin, (or openerp-server) directly. You will want to do this when you are working on developing migration scripts for uncovered modules. Get the code \u00b6 OpenUpgrade \u00b6 PerfectWORK 3.3 Make the openupgrade_framework and the openupgrade_scripts modules available in the addons path in the Odoo instance of the new version. Or, for older versions: check out the OpenUpgrade source code from Github for the branches you need. Each branch migrates to its version from the previous version, so branch 13.0 migrates from 12.0 to 13.0. If you are migrating across multiple versions, you need to run each version of OpenUpgrade in order. Skipping versions is not supported . The OpenUpgrade repository includes both openupgrade_framework and openupgrade_scripts: https://github.com/OCA/openupgrade openupgradelib \u00b6 When installing the openupgradelib make sure you check out the latest version from github to get the latest updates and fixes: pip install git+https://github.com/OCA/openupgradelib.git@master#egg = openupgradelib Check migration scripts for installed modules \u00b6 Check if there are migration scripts provided for the set of modules that are installed in your Odoo database. If there are modules for which no migration scripts have been developed yet, your migration may fail or the integrity of your database may be lacking. Check the module coverage in this documentation under Module coverage and refer to the Migration script development documentation to add the missing migration scripts. The simplest way to do this by running the following command: ./odoo-bin -c pw.conf -d [ database ] -u all Remove modules not available \u00b6 You may need to remove those modules, which are obselete in the next major version backend theme ( pw_backend_theme ) OCA web_responsive module Flectra converted modules website and related modules Clean up database \u00b6 May need to install the following module for database cleanup https://apps.odoo.com/apps/modules/11.0/database_cleanup/ OCA and SYC modules \u00b6 Please ensure all the addons for the database are located in the addons path ( PW_ADDONS.2.5 ) If the module is not available at the higher version, you need to remove the modules or you need to write your own migration scripts for the module. Make a copy of the database \u00b6 Decide which database you are going to upgrade. You absolutely must make a backup of your live database before you start this process! Adjust the configuration for Odoo and OpenUpgrade \u00b6 Edit the configuration files and command line parameters to point to the database you are going to upgrade. The recommended command line parameters are the --update all --stop-after-init --load=base,web,openupgrade_framework flags. For versions earlier than 14.0 that are running the OpenUpgrade fork rather than Odoo itself, you do not pass the load parameter . Configuration options \u00b6 When migrating across several versions of Odoo, setting the target version as an environment variable allows OpenUpgrade to skip methods that are called in every version but really only need to run in the target version. Make the target version available to OpenUpgrade with: export OPENUPGRADE_TARGET_VERSION=13.0 (when migrating up to 13.0) Obsolete options in the Odoo configuration file \u00b6 Versions of OpenUpgrade earlier than 14.0 allow for the following configuration options. Add these options to a separate stanza in the server configuration file under a header [openupgrade] autoinstall - A dictionary with module name keys and lists of module names as values. If a key module is installed on your database, the modules from the value (and their dependencies) are selected for installation as well. force_deps - A dictionary with module name keys and lists of module names as values. If a key module is installed on your database, the modules from the value will be treated as a module dependency. With this directive, you can manipulate the order in which the modules are migrated. If the modules from the value are not already installed on your database, they will be selected for installation (as will their dependencies). Be careful not to introduce a circular dependency using this directive. Run the upgrade, fix data and repeat\u2026 \u00b6 Run the upgrade and check for errors. You will probably learn a lot about your data and have to do some manual clean up before and after the upgrade. Expect to repeat the process several times as you encounter errors, clean up your data, and try again. If necessary, ask for help or report bugs on Github. Write the missing migration scripts \u00b6 At this stage, if some of your modules don\u2019t have yet migration scripts, you might need to add them yourself.
