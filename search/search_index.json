The dedicated infrastructure, as well as the operational capability, is the reason for the widespread adoption of PerfectWORK by various business establishments.   Another aspect that PerfectWORK puts forward or holds as a feature is the localization aspects of PerfectWORK, perhaps it can be said as the main and the best feature of PerfectWORK helping the business organization to run the business as per their region and country of functioning.  With the localization element of the PerfectWORK platform, you will be able to define the taxes based on the country in that you operate in. The PerfectWORK Accounting module will help you to define the taxes and configure the various tax forms such as Sales tax, Purchase tax, Service tax, GST, VAT, Cess, and many more based on the region.   The Accounting module of PerfectWORK has a distinctive menu window where these configurations can be configured. Another aspect that is regarded as the localization aspect is the currency in which the business is conducted and the PerfectWORK platform helps you with defining a base currency based on the country which is being selected upon the configuration of PerfectWORK.  Furthermore, the PerfectWORK supports the operations of the business to run with multiple currencies which will be helpful for the functioning of multinational organizations. In addition, the invoice and bill generation will be based on the practices followed by the country or the region, and the companies functioning over there should be able to adapt to this methodology. With the PerfectWORK platform, you will be able to define the various constraints and attributes of the invoice and save them as templates to be further used in the future.   The localization aspect can also be seen in other modules of PerfectWORK such as the purchase management module where the product description and purchases can be done based on the government norms and the authorization provided by the concerned authority regarding the purchase. Similar aspects can also be seen in the sales module of PerfectWORK where the companies functioning in a region will have to follow certain norms and conditions based on the region. The PerfectWORK purchase, as well as sales modules, will have distinctive configuration menus as well as options to help you to bring the localization on these aspects.  The additional aspect of the localization element of PerfectWORK is the multi-language support of the platform helpful for multinational business organizations. You can bring in the operations of PerfectWORK to be functional in any language and the language settings can be easily changed based on your needs.   Human resource management also has to be functional based on the localization aspects of the region. The PerfectWORK platform allows you to define the recruitment process and other HR operations as per the rules and regulations of the governing authorities of the region. The aspects such as working hours, employee's leave, paid leaves, and vacation are certain aspects that can be defined by you in PerfectWORK.

In this system, when a transaction occurs and gets impacted in an account, a matched impact will occur in the other account. The corresponding debit value will be recorded for the credit value. In addition, the credited and debited accounts will be listed in the company chart of accounts.   When considering an example, suppose a sale is confirmed for $ 200. There will be an impact on both the Income Account and the Receivable Account. Since it is a sale for the organization, the income increases.

Furthermore, the PerfectWORK platform is provided with a settings menu in the Accounting module where various default options are available to be configured. The settings menu is available in all the modules of PerfectWORK providing the users with the full freedom of configuring the operational management and function of each.  You will have configurable options that are available in the form of enabling and disabling it using a selection box. There will also be options from which you can choose the entity from the drop-down menu helping you to configure the operation. All these forms of options are described based on the custom operational need.   You will also have the provision to bring in custom options while developing the platform which can be done with the help of expert PerfectWORK developers. Installing various third-party PerfectWORK apps available in the PerfectWORK app store will bring configurable options to the allocated modules helping you to define the operations.   The accounting module has a long list of configurational options that are available under the Settings tab for you to configure. These options will allow you to define the operations of the accounting operations as well as finance management just as you need.

But, when you work in a B2B environment, companies usually negotiate prices with taxes excluded.</p> <p>Odoo manages both use cases easily, as long as you register your prices on the product with taxes excluded or included, but not both together. If you manage all your prices with tax included (or excluded) only, you can still easily do sales order with a price having taxes excluded (or included): that\u2019s easy.</p> <p>This documentation is only for the specific use case where you need to have two references for the price (tax included or excluded), for the same product. The reason of the complexity is that there is not a symmetrical relationship with prices included and prices excluded, as shown in this use case, in belgium with a tax of 21%:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Your eCommerce has a product at 10\u20ac (taxes included)</p> </li> <li> <p>This would do 8.26\u20ac (taxes excluded) and a tax of 1.74\u20ac</p> </li> </ul> <p>But for the same use case, if you register the price without taxes on the product form (8.26\u20ac), you get a price with tax included at 9.99\u20ac, because:</p> <ul> <li>8.26\u20ac * 1.21 = 9.99\u20ac</li> </ul> <p>So, depending on how you register your prices on the product form, you will have different results for the price including taxes and the price excluding taxes:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Taxes Excluded: 8.26\u20ac &amp; 10.00\u20ac</p> </li> <li> <p>Taxes Included: 8.26\u20ac &amp; 9.99\u20ac</p> </li> </ul> <p>Note</p> <p>If you buy 100 pieces at 10\u20ac taxes included, it gets even more tricky. You will get: 1000\u20ac (taxes included) = 826.45\u20ac (price) + 173.55\u20ac (taxes) Which is very different from a price per piece at 8.26\u20ac tax excluded.</p> <p>This documentation explains how to handle the very specific use case where you need to handle the two prices (tax excluded and included) on the product form within the same company.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>In terms of finance, you have no more revenues selling your product at 10\u20ac instead of 9.99\u20ac (for a 21% tax), because your revenue will be exactly the same at 9.99\u20ac, only the tax is 0.01\u20ac higher. So, if you run an eCommerce in Belgium, make your customer a favor and set your price at 9.99\u20ac instead of 10\u20ac. Please note that this does not apply to 20\u20ac or 30\u20ac, or other tax rates, or a quantity &gt;1. You will also make you a favor since you can manage everything tax excluded, which is less error prone and easier for your salespeople.</p>"}, {"location": "01_application_guide/02_accounting/07_taxes/05_b2b_b2c_pricing/#configuration", "title": "Configuration\u00b6", "text": ""}, {"location": "01_application_guide/02_accounting/07_taxes/05_b2b_b2c_pricing/#introduction", "title": "Introduction\u00b6", "text": "<p>The best way to avoid this complexity is to choose only one way of managing your prices and stick to it: price without taxes or price with taxes included.

It can be either from a sales order or a manufacturing order. When the demand for a product happens in the destination location, Odoo will generate a picking operation type from the source location to complete the requirement. \u25cf Push To: You can use this rule to move a product to another location. When products arrive in the source location, you can move them to another location using this action. In this case, Odoo will generate a picking operation type to send them to the destination location. \u25cf Push &amp; Pull: This action can be used in both cases explained above. When products are needed in the destination location a picking is generated from the source location to fulfill the need. This demands product requirements in the source location. Once the source location is fulfilled with the requirement, the products will be pushed to the destination location to fulfill the needs of the destination location. \u25cf Manufacture: Using this action, you can directly generate manufacturing orders to complete the requirements of the source location. \u25cf Buy: When products are needed at the destination location, Odoo will generate a request for quotation to buy the product to fulfill the need with the help of this action.</p> <p>In the next fields, you can mention the Operation Type, Source Location, and Destination Location respectively.

Mention the Reference Sequence, Code, Barcode, Reservation Method, and Company in the respective fields. The Reservation Method will decide how the products in transfers of this operation type should be preserved. It can be either at confirmation, manually, or before the scheduled date. When validating a transfer, you can ask your users to choose if they want to create a backorder for the remaining products by selecting the option Ask in the Create Backorder field. By selecting the Always option, Odoo will automatically create a backorder for the remaining products. Selecting the Never option will cancel the remaining products.

Tracking a product at each stage of stock movement is necessary to bring all operations under control. In order to ensure effective monitoring of the stock movement, lots and serial numbers play an important role. From manufacturing processes to delivery operations, product traceability will keep a proper track that improves the efficiency of stock management. Proper monitoring is required to reduce the risk factors during the stock movements of any company. The Odoo ERP system will record exact details of the stock movement of each component of a product in inventory in the form of a traceability report. The user can observe the whole production to distribution procedures in the inventory using the lots and serial numbers.</p> <p>Lots and serial numbers are not exactly the same. Commonly we use a lot as a unique identification number to identify a group of products of the same type. If the products are small or can not count as individual products, you can put them together in a single pack and allot a lot number. They are picked as batches in the inventory. For individual products, you can assign serial numbers. The serial number is considered to identify individual products in the inventory.</p> <p>We allocate lots and serial numbers for products at the time of their inventory management. You can assign lots and serial numbers to the products while configuring them in the Inventory module so that you can easily keep the traceability report of the respective products thereafter. The inventory management tools offered by Odoo 16 support this traceability feature to ensure effective tracking operations. In order to get the complete features of the traceability in the Inventory module, you are requested to activate the Lots &amp; Serial Numbers option from the Settings menu.</p> <p></p> <p>As shown in the image above, this feature will be available under the Traceability tab.
