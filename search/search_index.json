When you first access your PerfectWORK instance, the only functionality you will have is a limited messaging options between users. From there, PerfectWORK allows you to purchase and install the applications you need, as you need them. This flexibility makes PerfectWORK much more accessible than many business software solutions. Not long ago, nearly all companies kept their primary information systems in-house. This approach not only requires a lot of capital expense in purchasing servers and software licenses, but also creates a lot of responsibilities and risks in backing up data and ensuring business continuity. Today, more and more companies are choosing to host their business applications in online networks commonly called the cloud. PerfectWORK allows you the flexibility of both options\u2014either hosting on your own hardware, or utilizing PerfectWORK's online software services. The best thing about accessing PerfectWORK Online is that you can jump in and start using the software right away. You don't have to decide what operating system (OS) to use, and you don't have to install any software at all. Just enter the URL into your web browser and you are ready to get started. Another added benefit of taking this approach is that you will verify that your web browser is up to date and compatible with the latest version of PerfectWORK. You can expect to put a great deal of time into determining which PerfectWORK applications / modules are right for your company. Taking a few hours to use the PerfectWORK Online version is time well spent, and you can put off installing PerfectWORK until you are more certain it is the right software for your business. Browser Requirement \u00b6 PerfectWORK is designed to run on a variety of modern web browsers. Supported browsers include the following: - Google Chrome (recommended) - Firefox - Microsoft Edge - Safari Tip Macintosh users will need to make sure they are running macOS X or above. Users running older Macintosh systems are currently having difficulties running PerfectWORK version 3. Also, in our experience, Google Chrome tends to offer the best experience in working with PerfectWORK. Mobile phone and tablet support \u00b6 PerfectWORK has included native support for mobile phones and tablets. Menus are designed to flow and format properly. The new website application even includes a preview within the portal administration to emulate how the site would appear on a mobile phone. While you still suffer many of the limitations that come with a small screen size, the applications are functional and this makes it even easier for developers to create mobile Odoo applications.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"01_user_guide/01_platform/01_getting_started/01_overview/#browser-requirement","text":"PerfectWORK is designed to run on a variety of modern web browsers.

We'll also include some handy tips and tricks for easily getting around the system and making the most out of your experience with PerfectWORK. Application \u00b6 Once you log in you'll be on PerfectWORK's main menu where applications, or Apps, are represented by icons. At first, you may not see very many apps installed. Each app adds new functions to the database and they're installed as needed. To get started with building out your database, you will need to install the necessary apps for your business needs. To do this, navigate to the Apps application by clicking its icon . Global Search Apps aren't listed in alphabetical order, but you can easily navigate to an app by simply typing its name from the main menu. As you type, the installed apps will filter as well as other related items. This is extremely useful when you have multiple apps installed. Clicking the Apps icon will take you to the app repository where you can browse around for the apps that you want to install. From this screen, you can see which apps your database has installed already and you can browse through the available apps to install. If you click on the button on any application, you can see the application's overview page to see if you would like to use it before installing. When you're ready to install an app, simply click the button and wait for the application to load. Please Note: For larger apps, this process could take several minutes. Once the app is installed, you will be routed to either the initial setup screen of the application to begin configuring it, or to your database's homepage where you can see your newly installed apps. Search \u00b6 The Search area is persistent in every application in PerfectWORK and provides the ability to easily find information. Search is a very straightforward feature and is tailored to the application you're using. For example, you won't be able to find a Sale Order from the search bar in the CRM app . By typing in the name of a customer, project, employee, or another object, you can retrieve that to view within the application that you're using. For the purposes of this document, we've highlighted an enhanced search feature in PerfectWORK that will make searching even easier. As you type in the search bar, you will see a dropdown menu appear with different options available to help you quickly locate your desired information. In this example, we've searched the Sales application for \"Peter\" and are looking for a client \"Peter Lim\". As you begin typing in the search bar, PerfectWORK gives the option to search specific customer within the Sales application for the desired keyword. Any option with the arrow \u2023 icon next to it can be expanded with a click, and PerfectWORK will display the available items for the data type that match your keyword. The example above shows the \"Customer\" section expanded and, as you can see, all customers with the keyword \"Peter\" in their profile are shown. From here you can either select the specific customer record you want to see, or you can select the option to display all customers with \"Peter\" in their profile. Filters \u00b6 Filters appear directly beneath the Search bar and allow you to customize the data that is displayed on a given page within any application in PerfectWORK. While the filters themselves will vary depending on what application you're using. For this example we will go over the basics of how to use filters in the Sales application. To get started, navigate to the Sales app. (If it's not installed, follow the instructions above to install it.) Once you've launched the Sales application, Select Orders \u2023 Customers let's take a look at the Search area at the top right of the screen. Toggle the Filters Menu If you do not see Filters or Group By or Favorites underneath the search bar, click the spyglass icon (with the + sign in it) and they will appear. If you want to hide them from view, click the spyglass icon (with - sign in it) and they will be hidden again. Click the Filters option to review the Filters menu. Let's now go over how to make the most of your Filters. When you review the Filters that are available within each application, the options will be specific to the data that's housed within that application. The Sales application is displayed for this example, so the options you see in the menu are specific to Sales data. There will typically be a set of default filters that are present in the dropdown menu for you to choose from. If you don't see the data that you want to view in the default filters, you can use the Add Custom Filter option to create your own filters. When adding a custom filter, you can set as many conditions as you'd like for the information you need to pull. When you add multiple conditions to the same custom filter, PerfectWORK automatically adds the \"or\" parameter to the search. So, if you want to search for customers who like Chocolate Icing OR Strawberry Icing, you would set the first condition, then click Add a Condition This opens a new section where you'll enter your \"or\" conditions. When you're done, click . After you select the filters that you want to use, PerfectWORK will automatically search the records in the model you\u2019re on for the information you've selected. Your filter will be reflected in the search bar. Saving a Custom Filter Custom filters, by default, will be lost once you leave the application that you're using. If you would like to save these custom filters for future use, then you'll need to utilize the Favorites feature, covered below, to accomplish this. Group By \u00b6 This feature allows you to change how your data is grouped together to better visualize your information and inform your workflows. For example, you may want to see your pipeline data grouped by Salesperson, so you can review which opportunities are being handled by which of your salespeople. This is just one small example of what this feature can do. Like the Filters function discussed above, the ways that PerfectWORK will allow you to group your data will depend on the application that you're using and the page that you're on within that application. Also, like the Filters option, you can use the Add Custom Group button to create your own groupings if the default options do not suit your needs. Unlike Filters, custom groupings will only allow you to add one parameter to a Custom Group; however, you may create multiple Custom Groups and apply them together. PerfectWORK will add the grouping methods to one another and group the data as you've specified. Saving a Custom Group Custom Groups, by default, will be lost once you leave the application that you're using. If you would like to save these custom Groups for use in the future, then you will need to use the Favorites feature, covered in the next section, to accomplish this. Favorites \u00b6 This feature allows you to save custom searches that you've built using the Filters and Group By options covered above. Once you have your search or grouping parameters configured and selected, click the Favorites dropdown menu, then click Save current search and the following window will appear. In this window, enter a name for your Search or Custom Group, choose whether or not you want the system to default to this search when you open the application, and if you'd like to share this search with all other users of this application. Once you have made your selections, click SAVE . After you've successfully saved your custom Search or Group to your Favorites, simply go to Favorites and select it from the dropdown menu to utilize them in the future. Deleting a Favoutite If you would like to delete any of your Favorites, you simply click the trash can next to the name of the Favorite you want to delete and then confirm the deletion. Views \u00b6 This feature is similar to Group By, but instead of changing how the information is grouped on the page, it will change the method by which all of the data is displayed. Think of changing your Group By method like re-arranging information on a pie chart, while changing a View is like moving from a pie chart to a line graph. PerfectWORK has several different Views that you can choose from. Not all of them are available in every application, but we will cover all of them in this document so that when you come across a View you will know what it does. You can find the different Views that are available within any application tucked under the Search bar at the top right. Each View is denoted by an icon. Available views will vary between Apps. We will be going through each one and will provide examples of how the Views look when selected. For the purposes of this article, we will be using the same data for every view so that you can see the ways that your data can be manipulated simply by changing a View. If you hover over each View's icon, you will see a tool-tip telling you the name of the View. Kanban \u00b6 This View will allow you to create a kanban board to view your data. Kanban is an organizational method that typically uses columns and cards to visualize data. As each project, task, or item moves through the kanban sequence from left to right, you can easily track where each item is in its lifecycle. The example below is from the Sales Pipeline within the CRM application. As you can see from the below screenshot, the Kanban View is selected from the View options and we have our Sales Pipeline organized by stages. Each column represents a different stage in the Sales process and you can see the Opportunities under each stage. You can always change the stage that an item is in by dragging and dropping it into the correct column. You can also re-organize the columns by dragging and dropping them to the appropriate placement within the process flow. To the far right, you also have the option to Add a Column to create a new Stage of the process flow. Once created, you can drag-and-drop to wherever you'd like within the Kanban view. Once your stages are set up, you can begin assigning items to them. List \u00b6 This View will organize your data into a list format. As you can see below, all of the same information from the Pipeline View is still present in our List view (e.g. Stage, Expected Revenue, Opportunity, and Customer) and some new information has become visible in this view (e.g. Probability and Created On). Some column headers will show an arrow on hover. This indicates that clicking that column header will sort it in either ascending or descending order, and clicking it again will reverse the sort order. Not all fields have this feature. Exposing Columns On the top-right of many different list views in PerfectWORK, you'll see the vertical ellipses icon. Clicking this icon allows you to expose other available columns. Because the data availability will change between apps and views, the options in this fly-out menu will also differ. Calendar \u00b6 This View allows you to see your Scheduled Activities in a calendar. You can see your upcoming events by the Day, Week, or Month. The calendar will only show items that are created under the Schedule Activity section for each item listed in our Sales Pipeline. As you can see from the screenshot below, the Calendar View is selected from the View options and the calendar is displayed by the Month. Pivot \u00b6 This View allows you to display your data in a Pivot Table. In the following example, the Pivot View is selected from the View menu. This displays our Sales Pipeline data in this format, showing the Expected Revenue for October at every Stage. Note that our table only displays October because that's when our sample database was created and there is no prior data. Graph \u00b6 This View allows you to create Graphs and visualize data points in four different ways: Pie Chart \u00b6 Bar Chart \u00b6 Line Chart \u00b6 To change the input data that gets used to create the different Graphs, click the MEASURE button and select the data that you would like to visualize from the dropdown menu. Activity \u00b6 This View allows you to see all of your upcoming Scheduled Activities for your tasks, clients, leads, opportunities, or any other element in your PerfectWORK applications. In the example below, we're in the CRM application so these are the scheduled activities in our Sales Pipeline for four different Opportunities. Each Opportunity has its own row and the dates of each scheduled activity shows in a column to the right. Activities in red are overdue, activities in orange are scheduled for today, and activities in green are scheduled for a time in the future. You can schedule additional activities by clicking the SCHEDULE AN ACTIVITY button at the bottom of the table. If you click on an Activity in the grid, you'll see what the Activity is, the scheduled date, and you can mark it as Done by clicking the checkmark icon that's greyed out on the right. You can also schedule additional activities for the row by clicking the SCHEDULE AN ACTIVITY button at the bottom of the pop-up. Actions \u00b6 This feature allows you to take specific actions on an object within PerfectWORK applications. This could be anything from setting up access to your system for your users, sending a customer an SMS message, or editing a customer record. To get started, navigate to the Contacts application. If you don't have this application installed, please do so now. When you click the Action menu, you will get a set of pre-determined actions that you can take to modify or interact with that object. These options will vary depending on the application that you're in, and what you are currently viewing or modifying. As you work in PerfectWORK, keep an eye out for the Action menu as it can be a great shortcut to what you're trying to do.","title":"Navigation - UI"},{"location":"01_user_guide/01_platform/01_getting_started/02_navigation/#application","text":"Once you log in you'll be on PerfectWORK's main menu where applications, or Apps, are represented by icons.

As PerfectWORK is based on Odoo framework, table below shows the matching of Odoo version of PerfectWORK releases. PerfectWORK and Odoo version PerfectWORK Odoo Community 2.0 11.0 2.5 12.0 3.0 13.0 3.3 14.0 3.6 15.0 4.0 16.0 Introduction \u00b6 Odoo is an open source business application suite and development platform. This project, OpenUpgrade, aims to provide an Open Source upgrade path for Odoo. This is a community initiative, as the open source version of Odoo does not support migrations from one major release to another. Instead, migrations are part of a support package sold by Odoo SA. Note that the name of the project refers to the old name of Odoo, OpenERP. The project is hosted as two separate GitHub projects https://github.com/OCA/openupgrade The branches in the first project contain the framework, as well as the database analysis and the migration scripts. https://github.com/OCA/openupgradelib The second project contains a library with helper functions. It can be used in the migration of any Odoo module. Changes in OpenUpgrade for PW 3.3 Before Odoo 14.0, the branches in https://github.com/OCA/openupgrade contain copies (or forks in Git terminology) of the Odoo main project, but with extra commits that include the framework, and the analysis and the migration scripts for each module. Migrating your database \u00b6 Check out the code manually and upgrade your database by calling odoo-bin, (or openerp-server) directly. You will want to do this when you are working on developing migration scripts for uncovered modules. Get the code \u00b6 OpenUpgrade \u00b6 PerfectWORK 3.3 Make the openupgrade_framework and the openupgrade_scripts modules available in the addons path in the Odoo instance of the new version. Or, for older versions: check out the OpenUpgrade source code from Github for the branches you need. Each branch migrates to its version from the previous version, so branch 13.0 migrates from 12.0 to 13.0. If you are migrating across multiple versions, you need to run each version of OpenUpgrade in order. Skipping versions is not supported . The OpenUpgrade repository includes both openupgrade_framework and openupgrade_scripts: https://github.com/OCA/openupgrade openupgradelib \u00b6 When installing the openupgradelib make sure you check out the latest version from github to get the latest updates and fixes: pip install git+https://github.com/OCA/openupgradelib.git@master#egg = openupgradelib Check migration scripts for installed modules \u00b6 Check if there are migration scripts provided for the set of modules that are installed in your Odoo database. If there are modules for which no migration scripts have been developed yet, your migration may fail or the integrity of your database may be lacking. Check the module coverage in this documentation under Module coverage and refer to the Migration script development documentation to add the missing migration scripts. The simplest way to do this by running the following command: ./odoo-bin -c pw.conf -d [ database ] -u all Remove modules not available \u00b6 You may need to remove those modules, which are obselete in the next major version backend theme ( pw_backend_theme ) OCA web_responsive module Flectra converted modules website and related modules Clean up database \u00b6 May need to install the following module for database cleanup https://apps.odoo.com/apps/modules/11.0/database_cleanup/ OCA and SYC modules \u00b6 Please ensure all the addons for the database are located in the addons path ( PW_ADDONS.2.5 ) If the module is not available at the higher version, you need to remove the modules or you need to write your own migration scripts for the module. Make a copy of the database \u00b6 Decide which database you are going to upgrade. You absolutely must make a backup of your live database before you start this process! Adjust the configuration for Odoo and OpenUpgrade \u00b6 Edit the configuration files and command line parameters to point to the database you are going to upgrade. The recommended command line parameters are the --update all --stop-after-init --load=base,web,openupgrade_framework flags. For versions earlier than 14.0 that are running the OpenUpgrade fork rather than Odoo itself, you do not pass the load parameter . Configuration options \u00b6 When migrating across several versions of Odoo, setting the target version as an environment variable allows OpenUpgrade to skip methods that are called in every version but really only need to run in the target version. Make the target version available to OpenUpgrade with: export OPENUPGRADE_TARGET_VERSION=13.0 (when migrating up to 13.0) Obsolete options in the Odoo configuration file\u00b6 \u00b6 Versions of OpenUpgrade earlier than 14.0 allow for the following configuration options. Add these options to a separate stanza in the server configuration file under a header [openupgrade] autoinstall - A dictionary with module name keys and lists of module names as values. If a key module is installed on your database, the modules from the value (and their dependencies) are selected for installation as well. force_deps - A dictionary with module name keys and lists of module names as values. If a key module is installed on your database, the modules from the value will be treated as a module dependency. With this directive, you can manipulate the order in which the modules are migrated. If the modules from the value are not already installed on your database, they will be selected for installation (as will their dependencies). Be careful not to introduce a circular dependency using this directive. Run the upgrade, fix data and repeat\u2026 \u00b6 Run the upgrade and check for errors. You will probably learn a lot about your data and have to do some manual clean up before and after the upgrade. Expect to repeat the process several times as you encounter errors, clean up your data, and try again. If necessary, ask for help or report bugs on Github. Write the missing migration scripts \u00b6 At this stage, if some of your modules don\u2019t have yet migration scripts, you might need to add them yourself.
