It can be either from a sales order or a manufacturing order. When the demand for a product happens in the destination location, Odoo will generate a picking operation type from the source location to complete the requirement. \u25cf Push To: You can use this rule to move a product to another location. When products arrive in the source location, you can move them to another location using this action. In this case, Odoo will generate a picking operation type to send them to the destination location. \u25cf Push &amp; Pull: This action can be used in both cases explained above. When products are needed in the destination location a picking is generated from the source location to fulfill the need. This demands product requirements in the source location. Once the source location is fulfilled with the requirement, the products will be pushed to the destination location to fulfill the needs of the destination location. \u25cf Manufacture: Using this action, you can directly generate manufacturing orders to complete the requirements of the source location. \u25cf Buy: When products are needed at the destination location, Odoo will generate a request for quotation to buy the product to fulfill the need with the help of this action.</p> <p>In the next fields, you can mention the Operation Type, Source Location, and Destination Location respectively.

The Operation Types menu can be accessed from the Configuration menu as shown below.</p> <p></p> <p>Clicking on this option opens a new window with the details of the already configured operation types. You can make changes to the available operation types by selecting them from the given list. Here, we are going to create a new Operation Type. So, click on the Create button.</p> <p></p> <p>Here, you will get a new window to create a new operation type. You can mention the Operation Type in the corresponding field. Mention the Reference Sequence, Code, Barcode, Reservation Method, and Company in the respective fields. The Reservation Method will decide how the products in transfers of this operation type should be preserved. It can be either at confirmation, manually, or before the scheduled date. When validating a transfer, you can ask your users to choose if they want to create a backorder for the remaining products by selecting the option Ask in the Create Backorder field. By selecting the Always option, Odoo will automatically create a backorder for the remaining products. Selecting the Never option will cancel the remaining products. If you want to show a detailed stock operation in the picking lines then you can check the Show Detailed Operation box.</p> <p>The Default Source Location and Default Destination Location of the transfers of this operation type can be specified in the corresponding fields under the Locations tab.</p> <p>The Type of Operation can be Receipt, Delivery, Manufacturing, or Internal Transfer. Based on the Type of Operation you select, there will be small changes in the remaining fields. Each Type of Operation has different configuration options. For example, if you select Receipt as the Type of Operation the additional fields that appear on the screen are highlighted below.</p> <p></p> <p>Here, in the case of Receipt, you can activate the Show Reception Report at Validation feature if you want to get an automated reception report at the time of validation. In the Operation Type for Returns field, you can specify the operation type suitable for the return operations of the products. Odoo will automatically pre-fill the detailed operations with the corresponding products, location, and lot/serial numbers.</p> <p>By activating the Create New Lots/Serial Numbers option from the Traceability tab, Odoo will allow you to create new lots/serial numbers for the products in the transfers of this operation type. You can also use the existing lots/serial numbers for product transfers by activating the Use Existing Lots/Serial Numbers option. By checking the Move Entire Packages box from the Packages tab, you will be able to select entire packages to move.</p> <p>The Product traceability feature offered by Odoo will assist in tracing and tracking each and every component of a product. Tracking a product at each stage of stock movement is necessary to bring all operations under control. In order to ensure effective monitoring of the stock movement, lots and serial numbers play an important role. From manufacturing processes to delivery operations, product traceability will keep a proper track that improves the efficiency of stock management. Proper monitoring is required to reduce the risk factors during the stock movements of any company. The Odoo ERP system will record exact details of the stock movement of each component of a product in inventory in the form of a traceability report. The user can observe the whole production to distribution procedures in the inventory using the lots and serial numbers.</p> <p>Lots and serial numbers are not exactly the same. Commonly we use a lot as a unique identification number to identify a group of products of the same type. If the products are small or can not count as individual products, you can put them together in a single pack and allot a lot number. They are picked as batches in the inventory. For individual products, you can assign serial numbers. The serial number is considered to identify individual products in the inventory.</p> <p>We allocate lots and serial numbers for products at the time of their inventory management. You can assign lots and serial numbers to the products while configuring them in the Inventory module so that you can easily keep the traceability report of the respective products thereafter. The inventory management tools offered by Odoo 16 support this traceability feature to ensure effective tracking operations. In order to get the complete features of the traceability in the Inventory module, you are requested to activate the Lots &amp; Serial Numbers option from the Settings menu.</p> <p></p> <p>As shown in the image above, this feature will be available under the Traceability tab.
